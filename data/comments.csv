New flip, who dis?üòè"
i love the watch8 and the flip7 so much. might genuinely pick up a flip7. small cover display with crucial info is such a W
Damn I wish I didn‚Äôt upgrade to a 16 pro max in January I want this fold so bad
"If you can make it to a carrier store or [Samsung Experience Store](https://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-experience-store/locations/) and try the Fold7 in person, I highly recommend it. The thinness isn't something that translates well in pictures (or even seeing it in person, I got to see but not touch it before the Unpacked and I was still shocked when I unboxed my unit.)"
I want the Flip7! - Need to check it out thank you for sharing
Was impressed using it at Best buy still waiting for my delivery though to properly play around with it.
"Going to check out the ""vip event(don't know what that means) on Samsung stores this weekend with my wife. She is interested in getting watch 8, she says she likes the squircle shape of 8 lineup. Had the chance to check out the foldables at store, they seem to be very good and thin. If it gets a bigger battery, my wife is also going to be picking one up in the future."
"Kinda anxious about the flip, pre-ordered last sunday and the estimated shipping date by samsung portugal is 04 Aug..."
I have the fold 7. Been using it all day ans still around 45%. The thinness is amazing. The larger front screen is awesome too.
"Have the Fold 7 in JetBlack, such a sleek piece of kit. I have got the Watch 8 too (got that from Amazon) but I'm sending back today as the battery life is terrible (doesn't get through a day). 

With the watch 8 its probably my fault for going for the 40mm model but still."
still waiting for mine from Amazon. So sad
"Just got my fold 7, Early Life failure already, the 8in display is faulty and I can‚Äôt book a mail in service because it doesn‚Äôt exist at this moment because the model is too new, and they won‚Äôt send me a replacement until I have it assessed and repairs by an authorised Samsung repairer. Which doesn‚Äôt work weekends.

I have to take time off work to get a replacement, and after the **** around I‚Äôve had by Samsung support I‚Äôm actually thinking it‚Äôll be a refund.

Wanted to move away from Apple and I was super keen to have a fold but the whole repair/return process has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I don‚Äôt even think I want it anymore :/

Hopefully no one else has this experience because it sucks"
"so im looking for best in class cameras for close up watch photography. i understand thast for this the fold 7 has cameras equal to the s24 ultra (except telephoto) is this correct?

ive loved the pixel 8 and am looking to trade this year.

the oppo find 8 ultra isnt avaialable in the UK (my alternative)"
I have a Flip 7 on order through Xfinity. I haven't received a shipment notice. Any word on how those are going?
When will you be fulfilling preorders from day 1? How come instore customers get priority?
"Hello, I just upgraded my phone from the Flip 5 to the Flip 7, and am really not happy with the camera quality, especially when taking a photo of food.

I changed some settings, such as setting AI optimization to minimum, but it doesn't help much. It's very frustrating... any tips?"

I regret buying the blue titanium watch ultra 2025. It scuffs so easy into an uglg damaged watch. 2 days of use. I used a watch 6 classic before this and also had minor scratches after 2 years or so, but that wasnt so noticable. But what is worse, this thing is easier to scratch while its titanium?"
"thinking of getting the flip 7, is the 2-year premium care warranty worth it though?? I normally don't get warranty on devices but hear this one is fragile"
"I got the Fold 7 for my husband and the trade in has been sitting in Hutchins, Tx since August 2nd. Anyone else's trade in just sitting there? It said it was going to be delivered to the trade in place Monday Aug 4th."
I currently have a watch7 44. I bought the watch8 classic and the watch8 to try them out. I returned both and am sticking with my watch7. Just not feeling the design of either of them and prefer my 7.
"Fold 1 and fold 7 are sadly still the same device. The form factor needs to be passport style that way video content benefits from a larger screen with a proper aspect ratio, and the soft inner display is a turn off. I don‚Äôt want to manually think about how I‚Äôm using my phone hoping I‚Äôm not damaging it, that is a comprise through and through. It‚Äôs impressive how thin samsung has gotten the latest iteration but as of now it‚Äôs an elegant and more expensive fidget toy, with smartphone functionality."
What case do you have there?
This is the case I used on my fold 5 and now fold 7. It's so thin
How does it feel compared to the S25U? Any regrets aside from S-Pen functionality?
"How are you liking it so far? Lifelong iPhone user here, and I‚Äôm highly considering switching to this"
"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of Apple users switching to the fold 7 in multiple comment sections. 

the design must really be nice to sway Apple users."
You either got a faulty one or just didn't give it time to learn your usage patterns. First 24 hours with the 44mm and it was dropping fast. After 2 more days it's holding up to the reported measurements but I don't use AOD.
Aramid fiber thin case from aliexpress
no regrets. It's been an amazing experience. I can't imagine myself going back to slab phones.
"It's amazing, I love it, as a previous S23 Ultra owner"
"I‚Äôve had a Samsung before, the S8. Was my first and only android phone. It was cool but I was also in middle school when more people had iPhones lmao. Since ios26 was shown off though, I‚Äôve wanted to switch back"
"Can confirm. Although, I‚Äôm so entrenched in the Apple ecosystem I‚Äôm keeping my iPhone as a secondary and using BlueBubbles+Digits to straddle the line."
I am happy to hear that as I was considering the Fold7 but then was wondering if I should go for the S25U or wait for S26U. But this makes my decision easier.
I have the 15 pro max as my secondary phone and had no urge to upgrade to newer iPhones. the only way they will make me upgrade the iPhone would be an iPhone fold.
"Even though you used the OG Watch, do you believe that anyone coming from a Watch4 series should upgrade?"
How are the cameras? Planning of getting one to replace my S23+.
Do you notice any improvement on the shutter speed on the Fold 7 and if photos has gotten better due to the upgraded camera versus the Fold 6?
"Thanks for the breakdown and info. The design of the 8 Classic is my final Samsung straw, so leaving the whole brand. Would like to see you compare a real classic - the GW6 Classic 47mm to the GW8 ""Classic"". I think the screen size would be a standout, because they nerfed the screen on the GW8C to try to press people toward the Ultra. Really dumb of Samsung to try to put out what is usually 2 flagship models, so they forced themselves to nerf one. Imo, the 8 Classic is a trainwreck compared to real the real classics (4 and 6)."
S25ultra vs Fold7 --- can you compare cameras?
"How is the Fold7 folded screen compared to S25U? Some say it is plastic and not glass? I have Flip5 and I am bothered by the line in the middle of the screen (it becomes more apparent as time goes), would that be a thing in Fold7?"
Thinking about making this my first foldable. Do you think this is a good point to start? I went over from iOS to the S25 Ultra but this new design felt so nice in the hand. My only concerns would be durability of the inner screen and typing experience on the outer.
"Would also like to know how the cameras and performance are compared to the S23U, as I'm thinking about upgrading from that."
"I was thinking about swapping from an iPhone to a Fold 7, think it‚Äôll be a good idea?"
"I currently use an iPhone 15pm. I‚Äôm fairly deep into the Apple ecosystem, having AirPods, an iPad mini and a watch. Been an iPhone user for 7 years now and looking to switch back. To be quite frank, iOS has been very mundane to me lately, not to mention the weak Apple intelligence lineup and bugs that were noticeable to me on iOS 18. I‚Äôm willing to switch to the watch 8, and AirPods are still compatible for the most part from my understanding so that wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.


- will it tough to switch over? I don‚Äôt believe I have any iOS-exclusive apps, but I do use iCloud for syncing photos, etc.

- battery life seems to be one of the bigger pain points of the zf6, with the zf7 having the same battery but better CPU efficiency(?). Is it really that bad? I‚Äôm a fairly heavy user, relying on maps all the time as well as some gaming.

- how is Samsung Care (and Care+)? Is it almost necessary to get it for the zf7 due to the nature of the screen? Are they usually stingy with repairs?

- cameras: I don‚Äôt really take videos but do like to shoot still photos especially with ultrawide. How do the photos compare to your 16PM?"
"New size outer screen,  does it feel more like a regular phone when folded vs how slim the fold 6 feels?  My wife's s23 screen is wider than the fold 6 outer screen.

Have you had a chance to try any magsafe components?  If I recall they moved the magnet in the fold 6 which caused some magsafe stuff not to work properly.  The fold 6 on my wireless trio pad has to have the case off in order to charge properly.

My biggest gripe about my fold 6 is the thickness in my pocket with case and a magsafe kickstand.  Sell me!"
Classic 6 vs Classic 8 or FSE vs F7
"How long can a fold last bc i am very tempted, but I want also to last long. Do you think the fold 7 can do it until the last os update without issues?"
"How are the speakers on this thing? I bet its worse, but id like you opinion on it."
How does the Fold 7 feel when you're holding it in one hand? Does it feel like you're holding a brick in your hand? Is it easy on the palm of your hand? And on your wrist too?
"Why did Samsung fly you out, are you press?"
"Would it feel like a downgrade coming from the S25U?   
I currently have a S25U and I really enjoy the phone, specially the battery.   
Never had a Fold and a bit tempted to try it out, not sure how much I would use the inner screen though!"
How big of a deal do you think the loss of S Pen support is?
"So the official release date is 7/25 right? Will stores have one for demo now? I am really tempted to upgrade from S22 Ultra to this but like you said, I should feel it in my hand first."
"Ah, since this is your first galaxy watch for a while, maybe you can't answer this but for anyone else:

Do you notice the performance of the watch 8 series to be better than the watch 6? If I am correct they put the better processor on the watch 7, and the watch 8 has the same one. Is the performance actually better to a noticeable degree?"
"Hmm I didn't test out the finger print scanner but I certain loved the fold 5 finger print scanner lol

Can't get use to it after switching to s25u."
"I got quoted $800 to fix my Fold 5 without insurance... Ended up just trading it in for $600 credit and downgraded to an S25.

I paid Spectrum for 3+ years to have mobile insurance but I switched to T-mobile and lost the coverage so RIP me.

Would have loved to upgrade to the Fold 7 but I didn't want to have a $800+ phone balance again."
I ordered this and I‚Äôm coming from a iPhone 15 PM. The best phone I ever used was a Note 9. I‚Äôm still going to keep my MacBook Air but looking to upgrade my Beats Studio Buds to something a bit better. Do you have any recommendations?
"Overall in terms of everyday use, performance, and look-and-feel of the Fold7, would you choose it over the S25 Ultra? Please explain why in any case as I am currently running an A51 and would like to upgrade to a flagship level phone.

Bonus question, would you wait for the S26 Ultra that is rumoured to have the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 chip and 16 GB base model?"
"I have a S22+, battery does not hold up the entire day (even using it in batter save mode), and it came with the Exynos.

I was considering upgrading but I'm not yet convinced, and if I would upgade, I'm not sure if I would get my first foldable or not. I can get the S25 Ultra (512gb) for around 1010‚Ç¨ (base price is 1620‚Ç¨, though most places have it for cheaper \~1100‚Ç¨-1400‚Ç¨) and the Fold 7 (512gb) for around 1575‚Ç¨ (base price where I'm from is 2170‚Ç¨ pre-sale, 2290‚Ç¨ otherwise).

Do you think it's worth making the jump to a foldable? Stick to ultra or wait one or two more generations of foldables?"
"Picked up the fold 7 today, coming from a fold 5. Obviously the thinness is incredibly noticeable but the biggest for me so far is how much bigger the front display is, find myself using it a lot more than the 5 already.

In terms of negatives, not a fan of how top heavy it is with the bulky cameras but I guess that's the trade-off with people really wanting flagship cameras in these devices."
"Coming from iPhone, I used to have a pixel user for a few years. Samsungs software drove me up the wall when I used it before. Has it gotten better?

Google Pixel was really nice and didn‚Äôt have annoying apps triggering constantly."
"> The reduced thickness vs the Fold6 makes a massive difference in usability.
>
> Battery is ok. Not great, you'll definitely need to top up around dinner time if you're a heavy user

So you're saying we could have finally have gotten a Fold with amazing and not mediocre battery life in the same thickness as last year's device which was already thin enough to begin with?

Classic Samsung going for the stupid d*ck measuring contest that is the specs war over actual improvements for users. How disappointing."
"I might upgrade my watch4 to a watch6, is cheaper, rounded and has the rotating bezel, I planned to upgrade to 8 but the square shape is a dealbreaker for me. I want a watch that looks like a watch and as such is a circle. Hope the get it right with watch10"
"I have no real frame of reference so it's hard to say. Looking through the spec list the only things that jump out to me are the screen brightness and battery,  maybe the SoC but I don't know how the Watch4 performed.

From my experience though, I upgraded my Apple Watch Series 5 to a Series 10 a few months back and the difference was night and day. Watches don't change much, but 4-5 years is a good time frame for small upgrades to pile up. The UI was snappier, apps open and run faster, battery is much improved, event he small design changes built up over the years and actually noticeable after 5 years. If the Watch4 -> Watch8 is anything like that, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"The main camera is on par with the S25 Ultra now, but the ultrawide and telephoto are still a step behind. 

[Here are some sample shots](https://imgur.com/a/5gMaX9w)."
"Sutter speed seems about the same, especially in low light. While we were there they hosted a party after Unpacked where Jaden Smith performed, and all the pictures I took of him were blurry because he was moving around. 

I honestly don't remember much of the Fold6's camera, which I guess speaks for itself. It didn't leave me impressed, especially coming from an S24 Ultra and iPhone 15PM. The Fold7's primary lens holds its own from the shots I've taken so far, I don't feel like I'm taking a step down using it like I did with the Fold6. The other two lenses still feel a step behind though, I hope those are next in the Ultra-fication. 

[Here are some camera samples](https://imgur.com/a/5gMaX9w)."
"I like the look of the new 8 Classic. I like the look of the old 6C as well, I'm upgrading from one. I like watches that look like watches. The new 8C looks more like an old-school analogue watch than the 6C to me. The 6C always felt a little too thick, it stands out from the wrist quite a bit."
"LOLOL I SAID THE SAME THING AND EVERYONE AT UNPACKED TOLD ME THAT THE W8C WAS STILL CLASSY LOOKING. LIKE BRUH NO, I HAVE EYES.

I hope they come out with Watch 9 Classic or a real classic version."
"[Here are some camera samples from the Fold7](https://imgur.com/a/5gMaX9w). 

I didn't have enough pockets to do a side by side in NYC, but I'm planning on taking the S25U and Fold7 out in the next few days and getting some direct comparisons."
"Outer screen (folded) is glass, always had been on the Fold line. The inner screen (unfolded) top layer is the plastic part, that's where you'll still have a crease like the Flip5. The crease is supposed to be improved this year because of a wider teardrop when folded, which does look to be the case so far, but it's only a week old so well see how it holds up over time. 

The outer screen itself looks a little dimmer to me, and is missing the Ultra's anti reflective coating, but other than that it's fantastic."
"This would be a fantastic first foldable. Typing experience on the outer screen is fine, coming from an S25 Ultra its a little narrower but not to the point where its awkward. It's about the same width as a regular S25 or the regular size iPhones if you had one of those before switching. 

I don't think we're going to get around the plastic screen durability limitations any time soon, which is a bummer. They did make the UTG layer thicker this year, and made improvements to the backing layer behind the screen, but the top layer is still plastic and prone to scratching if you're not careful."

"If you're not fully entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, I think so. My primary is an iPhone and this is the closest I've come to ditching it. I'm actually in the process of setting up BlueBubbles so I can hop between the two without having to move my SIM over. It really makes me wish I didn't rely on all the little ecosystem integrations as much as I did."
"I also switched over (LG G Flex). The biggest pain points are iMessage, and apps (for me). You can use icloud on windows and even check icloud email on the web. That helped the most."
"i just did this exact switch from iOS to android (P9PXL to now S25U). It was easy for me as I used primarily google services. Sadly the watch can no longer be used, but the airpods work fine on the android. So in terms of software at least it was a while to adjust but has been better overall"
">	will it tough to switch over? I don‚Äôt believe I have any iOS-exclusive apps, but I do use iCloud for syncing photos, etc.

There‚Äôll be an adjustment period but if you don‚Äôt use anything iOS exclusive you‚Äôll probably be fine. Mainstream apps do feel a little more polished on iOS though. 

There are other cloud services you can replace iCloud with. For me, the biggest hurdle to switching would be the ecosystem niceties, those are hard to replace if you‚Äôre not switching every single device over to Samsung/Windows equivalents. 

>	battery life seems to be one of the bigger pain points of the zf6, with the zf7 having the same battery but better CPU efficiency(?). Is it really that bad? I‚Äôm a fairly heavy user, relying on maps all the time as well as some gaming.

It‚Äôs fine for light to medium usage but heavier usage like you‚Äôre describing will need a top up in the evening. I‚Äôve been getting around 5 hours SOT with some navigation, but no gaming. 

>	how is Samsung Care (and Care+)? Is it almost necessary to get it for the zf7 due to the nature of the screen? Are they usually stingy with repairs?

I‚Äôve never used it so I can‚Äôt speak to it. If it was my money I‚Äôd probably get it for the peace of mind. 

>	cameras: I don‚Äôt really take videos but do like to shoot still photos especially with ultrawide. How do the photos compare to your 16PM?

Main camera seems comparable in good lighting and low light if there isn‚Äôt motion, but low light + movement is still Samsung‚Äôs Achilles heal. Ultra wide and telephoto seems a step behind. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to do any side-by-side shots yet, planning on doing that a little later this week."
">	New size outer screen,  does it feel more like a regular phone when folded vs how slim the fold 6 feels?

Yes. It‚Äôs still a tall aspect ratio at 21:9, but width is roughly on par with the regular size S line phones. It‚Äôs a little narrower than the Plus/Ultra models though. 

>	Have you had a chance to try any magsafe components? 

I have not, but u/Stephancevallos905 has a case with magsafe magnets built in, he might have some comments. My only problem with wireless charging is I can‚Äôt keep the phone on the charger, the vibration motor makes it slide off. 

>	My biggest gripe about my fold 6 is the thickness in my pocket with case and a magsafe kickstand.  Sell me!

The thickness is one of the biggest changes this generation. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 100% worth it. It genuinely feels like a regular phone when folded, and it‚Äôs impossibly thin unfolded. If you can, try it in store. It‚Äôs hard to get an appreciation for just how thin it is through pictures, but [here it is next to an S25 Ultra anyway](https://imgur.com/a/PCMbjBW)."
">	Classic 6 vs Classic 8

Classic 6 if you value design, Classic 8 for longevity and the new health features. 

>	FSE vs F7

Fold7. The Fold SE is a terrible value in my opinion, if you really want to save $200 get the Fold6."
"Also, does it have a vapor chamber bc some people say it heats a lot mostly in the camera zone"
"I‚Äôm not sure, most people are fine but even the Fold6 was still seeing some units randomly crack the inner screen. They said they improved durability this year, thicker UTG, better adhesive for the plastic layer, and they replaced the carbon fiber backplane with titanium."
"It's a tiny bit quieter than the Fold6 (70 vs 73db at the same part of a song from a quick test) and a little less bass. Doesn't sound tinny though, thankfully."
"It feels good, kind of like a narrower S25 Ultra. You can definitely tell that it has less rounded corners, but it‚Äôs not uncomfortable to me at least, but I do have larger hands and the S25U wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable either."
They‚Äôve flown out a handful of redditors to the past few Unpacked events.
"It‚Äôs a downgrade in a few areas:

1.	S Pen. I rarely used it so I don‚Äôt mind, but if you rely on it you‚Äôll probably miss it. 
2.	5x telephoto camera, you only get the 3x here. This is what I miss the most. 
3.	Battery, it‚Äôs just not as good as the S25U, especially if you‚Äôre using the inner screen. It‚Äôs not bad by any means, but it is a downgrade from the ultra. 
4.	Anti reflective coating. There‚Äôs still a coating here like all smartphones, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre holding a mirror. It‚Äôs just missing the special coating the S24U and S25U got. You‚Äôll notice it mostly in the sun or under bright fluorescents, but I haven‚Äôt really noticed it much or found myself wishing I still had it. 

Personally, the only one of these that would make me consider the S25U over the Fold7 is the zoom lens. The rest either don‚Äôt affect me or are worth it for the big inner display."
"I rarely used it so I don‚Äôt miss it at all. I‚Äôve had the Note 9, Note 10+, S23U-S25U (and the Fold6 but I never bought the S Pen case for it) and across all of those I can count on my hands the number of times I genuinely needed it and wasn‚Äôt just finding excuses to use it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone there either, the product managers at Unpacked said their usage data showed that it wasn‚Äôt getting much use on the Fold, which is why the axed it while thinning down components. 

If you do rely on it that‚Äôs a different story, there‚Äôs just no replacement for it unfortunately. A regular stylus just doesn‚Äôt compare."
BestBuy and some carrier stores typically have them on display during preorders.
"I have used Watch 8 base and 6 Classic (since launch). The watch feels faster, but I don't know if that's from One UI Watch 8 or the chip. Also, compared to my Watch 6 Classic, since the screen is more accessible, gestures are much smoother. I know that's not really a comparison, but maybe I'll find out if I can manage to get a Watch 8 Classic or Ultra to compare them."
"That‚Äôs a tough one. I love the foldable form factor, but I feel like the camera is still a step down with the lesser telephoto. I think I‚Äôd go with the Fold7, the main camera is on the same level as the Ultra so I‚Äôm not completely giving that up, and being able to unfold and spread out is worth the step down in telephoto quality to me. 

The Snapdragon 8 Elite is already plenty powerful for me, so the upgrade to the Elite 2 wouldn‚Äôt factor into my decision."
"If you need an SPen, strong telephoto or top tier battery life I'd go for the Ultra, especially with that big of a price gap. If you're ok with compromising on those for the foldable form factor then the Fold7 is going to be a great buy. It's the closest to a no-compromise foldable we've had (in the US market at least, not sure how it is in Europe). IMO this generation is a turning point for the Fold line because it finally feels like a regular phone that happens to unfold; previous Galaxy Folds always had a ""but"" that would constantly remind you you're using a foldable but that isn't the case anymore."
"Could've had both if they switched to a silicon-carbon battery ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

Having used both though, the thinness really is worth it. The Fold7 is so much more comfortable to hold, it feels like a regular phone when closed. I would take the Fold7 design over the Fold6's with a bigger battery any day of the week. 

They haven't completely ruled out silicon-carbon, it sounded like they're just not sure about longevity and safety yet and want to do more testing. Maybe next year?"
Do you think the Fold series is worthy enough to switch to from an Ultra?
"Yeah, the definition of a classic style watch is ""simple, refined, and elegant"". None of those adjectives apply to the GW8C. I am pretty sure the whole reason the screen is small is if it were the same as the Ultra, way less people would buy the Ultra. I mean, if you like the squircle, and both had same screen size, you'd likely want the one that also has a rotating bezel. The whole thing is a cluster."
That's some good quality pics... would be great to compare both. I don't need anything crazy but fold6 was crap with pics. Currently rocking S25ultra but would like to go back to fold because of screen real estate but do need somewhat nice camera.
"Excellent! Yeah, as my apple product have slowly died I‚Äôve replaced them with products that better suit my needs from outside the eco system, and I refuse to use iCloud between my phone and iPad so I think I‚Äôll be chillin!

Just keen to try something different, a little disappointed with how Apple has stagnated over the past couple years"
"how are apps on zf7 (or android in general) versus an iPhone? Social media, games, etc. Are they well optimized? The reason I ask is because I used a pixel 8 on release for a month but would get micro stutters in mainstream social media apps like Meta apps or even Reddit. Though it may have just been a thing with the Tensor chip."
They removed the vapor chamber but added more graphite in its place.
"Not bad, not good either. Thanks for the reply. Looking forward to picking mine up on launch day."
What kind of wireless charger can you buy for The Fold 7? I want to buy a wireless charger for my Fold 7. Will all my music translate to the new device? I'm currently using The Musicolet App. What Color did you get?
How likely do you think it is that the next Fold or Ultra iteration pivots away from Snapdragon? I'm a little concerned since some tech reviewers seem to hint that this is on the table for Samsung.
I just called my local T-mobile and they didn't have them. I guess I'll check BestBuy.
"Gotcha, thanks for sharing!

I love my watch 6 classic, but the last 2ish months or so my watch 6 classic has been plagued by glitches, and im at the point where im pondering if trading it in for the watch 8 classic is a good idea ü§î idk"
Thanks for the feedback. I think I will wait for a couple more generations to get the foldable
"I guess to each their own? I can respect that. Personally though, I find it MUCH harder to tolerate any kind of compromise when a device costs that much. I could accept worse camera or battery life, but not both. Feels way to big of a trade off for the price or ""privilege"" to have a foldable. Still waiting for a Fold with either equal or better battery life or camera system to the Ultra lineup :( no matter the price"
"We're almost there, depends on how much you use the zoom lens or the S Pen. I'm personally addicted to background compression and love me a good zoom lens, so it's not quite there yet for me."
"Seriously, if anyone else feels the same way, voice it on here or other social media. Trust, they listen to our feedback"
I'm in the same situation with a s24ultra. But still can't justifify the purchase
"I used to have an XR since 2019 and I switched to a s24u earlier this year.  Completely worth it.

Like you I've been slowly switching my products out of that ecosystem."
">	What kind of wireless charger can you buy for The Fold 7?

Any qi charger will work, but I‚Äôd recommend something that either supports Samsung‚Äôs fast charge or qi2. 5w qi chargers are worthless.

>	Will all my music translate to the new device? I‚Äôm currently using The Musicolet App.

I‚Äôm not familiar with that app, but it is [available on the play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en_US). If they‚Äôre local files Smart Switch should transfer them for you.

Blue. By far the best color this year IMO."
"I don‚Äôt really know, but I doubt it. The Ultra used Snapdragon even when the regular S series was using Exynos overseas, and they switched the Flip to Exynos but kept the Fold on Snapdragon, so I hope they keep that pattern up."
Majority of the best buy stores have had demo units from the announcement day itself
"Love to hear it! I‚Äôm just looking to change it up, never been one of those people who hates on different OS or manufacturers and the fact that the fold has come out and is almost the exact same form factor as a slab phone when folded has got me giddy.

On top of that I‚Äôve had the opportunity to buy at an excellent price, and to be honest it‚Äôs whispering to me like the green goblin mask"
Can I buy a Wireless Charger from Amazon? What are some must have Accessories that I should buy for The Fold 7? Do you think that The Fold 7 will last longer than 5 years?
"Idk about the folds and I see comments criticizing all the time but honestly I saw a guy on a plane the other day using one and it looked cool af.

Check out some reviews and videos first"
"Yeah I‚Äôve been doing a bit of research and I think with my work and how many excel sheets I have to access on the fly, the pros outweigh the cons.

I think if I was paying the full RRP instead of like 50% off I wouldn‚Äôt be able to justify it. If Apple ever released a fold I‚Äôd probably swap back but I wouldn‚Äôt be mad if I got stuck with a Samsung fold for 2-4 years! (As long as the improvements to the hinge are real improvements and the screen doesn‚Äôt die on me in a year)"
"I tried the original fold and flip and they‚Äôre really cool fidget toys with smartphone functionality, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm not interested in them as a daily device. Far too many trade offs and durability concerns vs regular phones. moving parts that are exposed to the elements for something that is supposed to go into your pocket makes me nervous. I‚Äôm very interested in learning how google managed to make their upcoming pixel 10 pro fold IP68 compliant."
"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimer: Samsung gave me this phone after Galaxy Unpacked. I did not pay for this phone. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Sorry‚Ä¶ forgot to add that in."
"I 100% love the flip7. Had the flip6 before, this is a entire new league. Outside screen is just next level also so small bezels just looks great. Also the software for the outside screen finally very good. Have the razr 60 ultra as well to decide which one I like most. Ending up selling the razr keeping the flip 7.

Also the inner screen now a bit wider, finally feels like a normal phone compared to noticeably more narrow razr and flip6.

Haven't had any of the crease noise issues you mentioned, maybe you should have it checked. 
I was scared getting flip6 due to durability, but had zero issues.. Also got Samsung care+ insurance rocking it caseless. 

I'm now using the outside screen 70% of the time. Youtube is great on it. 

I got the fold6 as well, so mixing a bit."
Id rather fold than flip
looks like i wont upgrade from my 2019 note10 plus
"Turn on auto brigjtness when outside. Also if its dimming due to temp, u can increase that yhteshold through good luck display assistant"
I dont know how screen protectors work on folding but the samsung anti reflective film is basically mandatory on my S25. I wish samsung just shipped the phones with them pre installed. You can actually see the phone outside
Good review.
"I had a fold 5 could've upgraded to 7 but I switched to an ultra 25. I liked the huge screen but dealing with a plastic screen, stressful screen protector process, worse specs (if I got the 7 vs the u25), while also being super prone to DUST damage. I could never go back to a folding phone was nice while it lasted tho!"
I just can't unsee the seam. It messes with my mind for some reason.
[deleted]
One of my friends has this phone and when I see it I long for my old Nintendo Advance SP.  I used to always think that it would make a cool phone.
"My wife is a loyal Flip series user, while I myself have been a loyal Samsung user since the S4 series up until now with the S24.

Personally, I‚Äôm not interested in the Flip/Fold series because the inner screen feels too fragile. I prefer to use the tablet series instead."
"The cellular issues is most likely due to the chip nerf, which also holds the modem part."
"We all know it's expensive and has a half dozen trade-offs, but my question is what do you actually gain? I've had three of these things previously because I think they're neat. That's it. I still don't know of a single legitimate use case that a kickstand case on a regular brick phone can't also solve."
I think its a good device but you should have another mobile which will be for daily use. Pricing will take a hit next year as Exynos hardly sells and will bring its price down so maybe $200 cut we can expect like S24 series.
"As for cellular signal, blame the poorer and less efficient exynos modem"
The battery is pretty poor too i think
The cellular signal difference between the Flip and Fold this time is actually real. Flip 7 got Exynos 2500 SoC which has a different modem which is weaker. Fold 7 got Snapdragon 8 Elite which has the usual Snapdragon modem which is usually the best one on the market.
What's battery life like on these?
"Build quality is bad unfortunately.  They shipped mine with a broken microphone-1 then gave me a load of stick when I asked them to ship a replacement.  

Apparently they won't replace because they don't trust us, despite the fact Samsungs hardware quality/testing is the only thing that can't be trusted."
Samsung force dims your screen when it gets warm. Download display assistant from goodlock and there is a setting there to turn that off
"I'll be getting a Samsung later this week when am less busy from work, to ya'll more familiar with Samsung what's the best model/type to go for at time?? Help a brother ha ha"
"Why do people still think foldables will be comparable to the S series?

Do people not realize you sacrifice things to make it thinner?"
You could have worked all this out by watching a few reviews.
You should try the Z Fold7 then. A lot's changed. Feels more like a regular phone that just so happens to unfold. I use the cover screen way more than I thought I would now... even over the Z Fold6.
"The new Fold is arguably the first gen that the technology is matured and there are virtually zero tradeoffs. 

It‚Äôs a straight up foldable flagship, and doesn‚Äôt feel like a foldable A series"
"IV been using foldables for almost 5 years now, what's the actual trade offs you are converted about 

The camera is the only one I can see, it is worse but IV found it more than good enough 

I have had no durability issues with them, I think people have blown it way out of proportion"
"I never saw an appeal for a modern day phone that has an old school function to it. Unless, this was what Android started with amd we never went over to none-folding phones. Then, I could've seen the generational appeal. But, having multiple none-folding smartphones before. I don't see the appeal - not even the common ""use it less often"" rebutle. So, I just ended up with a Fold 7. Because, I've always wanted a tablet but I didn't want a seperwte device that only had a larger screen and no sim support."
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
What made you choose the Flip over the Razr Ultra?
Yeah I can say that for sure that the Flip7‚Äôs cover screen is fire. That‚Äôs so much nicer to use over the Flip6.
"So would I, but that's just me. I just like the pocketability of the Flip better."
I will say I do love my Z Fold7. Way more but that sold me on at least those type of foldables and hopefully tri-folds.
"I mean, you don't get the flip/fold as a daily driver. You get them because they're cool and you want them as a flex.

Daily drivers are anything but the flips and folds."
"It is on auto, and has nothing to do with temp. It's just too dark."
Thanks! I do this for a living‚Ä¶ but in video form. lol.

"I'm doing the opposite. I've had notes/ultras since the note 2. I tried the flip 3, didn't like it. Had to open it up to do most things. Tried the fold 5, didn't like it. Too bulky and heavy. Landed on the 25 Ultra in February and really liked it but found it kind of boring. I'm ready to really give the fold a try so traded my 25u for fold 7. Loving it so far!!"
Samsung fixed that a lot! Idk how it was with the Flip6 but I remember how it was with the Flip5 and it‚Äôs a lot less pronounced. Gotta give Samsung credit for that.
Flip 7. You'll get a day from medium/light usage.
Why‚Äôs everybody making excuses for Samsung? The phone isn‚Äôt warm. It‚Äôs just dim.
"Never said I wanted it to be an S25 Ultra, but for things like the screen brightness that has nothing to do with the sacrifice of ‚Äúmaking it thinner‚Äù"
You think me watching a few reviews is gonna fix the hardware limitations I don't like?
"I agree, I went to my local tech place that had demo ones to look at and measure it up against my s25u and its insane how thin it is. It was genuinely the same if not thinner than my phone. Id love it but it is too expensive and as much as I'd love to have a phone that turns into a small tablet, I'd rather have optical zoom lenses and overall a better cameraüòÇ"
I can comfortably use the fold 7 front screen and it feels like a slightly skinnier s25+ or similar.  Significantly thinner with a case than my flip 5 without a case.  I don't feel the need to open it all the time and I'm less worried about the inside panel
Yeah it's a huge improvement over the Fold5. I was going to return to the ultra series until the fold7 made it a normal phone width when folded.
I heard the camera was not good but the again it's not good one any model imo.
"You can seriously sit there and pretend that the folding devices many times less durable than a candybar.

And the fact is they are even more expensive than the already really expensive flagships. 

With 3 year contracts now its unlikely that a folding phone will survive without showing serious creasing (if not worse) when used as much as a traditional bar phone"
"Durability for one, a phone with moving parts will never be as durable as one without. The inner display is still a plastic polymer laminate with 50 micron thick glass middle layer you never touch, which means I have to constantly be mindful of how hard I press. I don‚Äôt want to manually think ‚Äúis my screen okay, did I press too hard?‚Äù that alone is a compromised experience.

Material choice is another issue. For $2000 I expect premium materials, yet this uses the same aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 as the baseline Galaxy S25. At this level of thickness, titanium paired with Gorilla Armor should have been standard. Titanium has vastly higher tensile strength than aluminum alloys, so its omission is surprising.

The camera system is mostly on par with the S25 Ultra, but it‚Äôs missing the periscope telephoto lens the only other lens I actually care about. The ultra wide can be dropped for all it‚Äôs worth.

Battery life is still mediocre. Silicon carbide batteries have been in the works and would realistically provide about 50% more life at the same thickness. The only reason I can imagine this wasn‚Äôt implemented is to hold it back as the Z Fold 8‚Äôs main selling point planned obsolescence at work.

Finally, dropping S Pen functionality is just strange. A larger inner canvas would only benefit from stylus support. Even if there‚Äôs no space to store one internally, compatibility should have been preserved.

The most amount of money buys you a curiosity that is visually stunning but still paired back and contains flaws that muddle the experience. I‚Äôd rather stick with my bar smartphone that is boring but has the best of everything Samsung can currently offer. At this rate I‚Äôm sure by Z fold 10 or 11 they will be spec wise identical to the ultra phone, only thing there is hoping they finally move to solid willow glass."
Reading this makes me feel old.
"I do, so much so it makes me picky in what I expect im a third category of device to move me from my current setup."
Maybe for some people. That's not really true as a general statement though.
Speak for yourself. My fold 7 has been a game changer for wherever I go since I got it.
"I traded my s25u for fold 7 as a daily driver, and it's great. I do not think I'd go back to a regular phone as a daily driver again"
Odd. It normally has the same brightness as s25 series
Nice! Good bot
Yeah I traded my s25u for fold 7 no regrets
This üëÜ
ü§£
Never said you did.
Not buying every new release probably will.
"I have short stubby thumbs so the skinnier screen is perfect for me, it also is more comfortable in my pants pocket. I really can't see myself going back to a regular phone now."
I've never found a phone camera that doesn't suck ass when compared to an actual camera.
"Who cares if its technically less durable?  It's durable enough, more than 

Mine have survived the same drops and dips in the bath as other phones and been fine. It'd not an issue in real life"
"Is just can't agree that any of that is flaws 

The screen thing is definitely blown out of proportion, I have never worried about  pressing the screen too hard, that's just the fault of YouTubers jabbing nails into the thing, if you are pressing your screen that way, you are a big old weirdo

The battery lasts easily over 24 hours with my normal use, like 6 hours SOT, wireless android auto for an hour etc,  so it's not an issue , charging every night isnt an issue , how long do you want the thing to last? What are you doing with your phone that needss so much battery?

I have never met another fold owner with an s pen, when it was a thing, I used to have a note and the pen was a fidget toy. People just don't use them."
"that's one way to put it. Another way is, that flip phones stopped existing for like 12 years after they were only mass-used for like 8-9yrs?"
"No, you clearly don‚Äôt because you‚Äôve barely touched the foldables that you are referencing. 

You‚Äôre not even actually aware of the trade-offs with regular devices."
"Literally have never seen a fold do anything a normal phone can't other than unfold and multitask.

Even then, what can you even multitask? Excel and YouTube? Could do that with my 25 Ultra already with enough screen space. Consume media? Yeah with huge black bars that defeats the purpose of the additional screen space.

If anything it just reduces your privacy in a public setting. Huge ass screen and anyone could see what you're doing. 

Have yet to justify getting a Fold. Flip makes alot more sense since it unfolds to a normal phone size."
"Huh? Your comments are confusing as hell. You implied he did say that but he never did, which you acknowledge. So what is the point of your original comment? ü§¶"
If you're still sporting an S9 maybe watch less reviews with that logic ü§£ü§£ü§£.
"It‚Äôs great that your foldable has held up so far, but you‚Äôve either been lucky or really careful with it. Drop it even once face down, or put anything harder than a microfiber cloth on the screen, and it would get scratched or at worse dented. My Nintendo DS screens ended up full of scratches and dents and those weren‚Äôt even flexible just regular plastic covered LCD panels. Plastic covered screens are fragile, plain and simple."
"Plastic displays are inherently fragile. They deform and scratch from anything harder than cloth or skin. This is the same durability flaw that made resistive touchscreens from decades ago unappealing and it hasn‚Äôt gone away.

Battery capacity should never plateau at ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù Progress means pushing until the ceiling is reached. The less frequently a phone needs charging, the longer the battery‚Äôs physical lifespan. Settling early is just complacency.

Dismissing the S Pen because ‚Äúmost people don‚Äôt use it‚Äù is anecdotal reasoning. By that logic, half of Samsung‚Äôs own software suite should also be scrapped since many users prefer Google‚Äôs versions. Usage varies, but availability is what creates value."
"I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way, taking my stance this personally isn‚Äôt healthy."
">Literally have never seen a fold do anything a normal phone can't other than unfold and multitask.

I've never seen an airplane do anything my car can't do except fly...

Like, my guy, that's the entire point."
"Many things the fold can do than a normal phone can't, tent mode, phone stand for watching content, it can actually as a tripod, can take pictures with cover screen showing to help the subject position themselves, the list is endless. I find a lot more convenience with my fold 7 than any other slab phone I have had in recent times. 

You're probably just salty because you can't acquire one yourself üëçüèæ"
"Shows what you're talking about. 

I don't have an S9"
"I think you are just looking to hate tbh and dismissing things because it's not better than as physically possible and missing out on things over things that are only ""technically"" and issue 

I'm half a decade into these devices and nothing you are saying has ever actually been a real issue for me or anyone else IV know yo actually own one 

The s pen is dead, Samsung wouldn't kill it if people actually used it. It's only the internet that actually complains about it. Real people just don't use the feature, and they won't keep developing it for 5 people. Samsung have the telemetry, they know what's being used. They wouldnt kill it if the data showed people cared"
"> Dismissing the S Pen because ‚Äúmost people don‚Äôt use it‚Äù is anecdotal reasoning.

oh the irony"
"I don‚Äôt take anything personally. It‚Äôs not healthy to assume things. I‚Äôm just saying you shouldn‚Äôt be commenting when you have near zero experience with the devices, per your own comment."
"You didn't even read my reply properly. I literally said a normal phone can multi-task too. Which meant the only good thing it can do is the unfolding. Dude is literally defending paying hundreds more just for the ability to... Open the phone. 

The fact that you made that analogy just explains everything. No shit a plane can fly and a car can't. It's designed to carry hundreds of people to go far distances. 

Smartest fold user."
"All those that you mentioned could be done with a <$50 accessory. I have a S25U myself during launch, so I would have no qualms getting a Fold 7.

Fold users really thought those features justify the hundreds of extra dollars it costs.

No different than an iPhone user."
Same difference. Old af.
"¬†I just don‚Äôt see foldables as a compelling third device category at the moment. The tech landscape is already saturated, and while foldables could potentially give me a reason to move away from my Galaxy and iPad setup, they haven‚Äôt done so yet. Disagreeing with you doesn‚Äôt make me a ‚Äúhater.‚Äù The real issue today is that people often can‚Äôt accept differing opinions, they instead shut them down and close off any meaningful discussion."
"Having a phone that folds is definitely worth paying for to some people, especially the flip form factor. The flip fits in a small clutch/purse where a slab phone does not. The flip fits in back pockets where a slab phone does not. 

Youve got to realize dude that not everyone's life is like yours and different people have different priorities. A couple hundred bucks is absolutely nothing over the life of a phone. Let's say it's a $500 difference and I'm going to keep the phone for two years. That's less than $1.50 a day for the convenience of a phone fitting in my pocket or my wife phone fitting in her hand bag and me not having to carry it for her. Literally less than the cost of a bottle of water. That's absolutely worth it."
"But that's it, I don't need to buy an accessorie to do it, I can do it with my phone as is lol"
"It's because you think ""old af"" means it's bad.

Buy the next flip. It's only a few months away üòÇ"
"Like I said in the other reply, the flip would make more sense out of the 2 because it unfolds into a normal sized phone. If anything, I'd get the Flip 7 too because it's so thin. But until there's a proper reason to get a Fold 7 other than, ""I now have the size of 2 phone screens side by side but with the power and battery life of 1"", I can't justify getting the Fold 7.

Flip 7 though, I'd get in a heartbeat if I hadn't already gotten the 25 Ultra with all the customisations and what not. Too lazy to swap over to the Flip 7. Might get the Flip 9 or 10 though!"
"You'd pay a ton of extra money just for the ability to make the phone stand on its own without an accessory? More power to you I guess.

A consumer consumes after all."
Nope old is not bad just stop talking shit when people buy a phone you don't like. I have an s24 ultra. No need to upgrade.
$1.50 a day for a fold is worth it to me for just having a cool phone. Totally worth it. Not to mention that I'm on an airplane 40-50 days a year so it's worth $1.50 to have a bigger screen to watch shows on.
"That's not why I bought the phone, regular phones get boring I wanted something new and interesting, and that's exactly what it is.

You're simply just a hater"
s24 Ultra is OLD AF.
"But the bigger screen isn't even a bigger screen. The media you consume are all designed for 16:9 or 21:9 or some weird aspect ratio inbetween so the top and bottom black bars are HUGE. Go to a Samsung shop and compare it side by side, and the video size is roughly the same, just with bigger black bars on the Fold 7.

If maybe it unfold twice, like the Huawei Mate XT (the triple fold), then yeah I would be on-board with the media consumption reasoning, and even more for a cool phone.

Don't get me wrong, I too would buy a phone for how cool it is. But fold isn't one of em. Maybe when Samsung releases a Trifold, I'd jump on it."
"Some thing new and not boring?

The ability to unfold for $500 more! Chipset? Camera? All the same. 

I'm not a hater. I'm just not dumb. Sounds like you got sunken cost fallacy there, buddy. Justifying an extra $500 for... tent feature... ability to stand...

Smartest fold user fr."
"Wait, til I tell you about this troll I met online that's sporting the long discontinued Note 9. ü¶ïü¶ïü§£ü§£"
"""Iconic design"" üò¢"
Better color than the 3 Pro.
Color looks great but I'll probably ditch Samsung headphones so long as they have that cheap copy airpod look.
"This form factor is so shit, can't use them laying on my side in bed 

My buds 2 pro will be here for the long haul"
No design will be as iconic as the Beans/Buds Live
Hope they ditch the stem in future models.
"Matte black is nice, but i still like the original fe design the best."
What's the difference between the 3 FE and the 3 Pro?
Buds live successor when?? I'm still on the original one lol
"Copying apple is now considered iconic for Samsung. 
How the mighty have fallen."
RIP Galaxy Beans
might grab a pair and use my b3p only for work and these for anything else
"Just buy JBL earbuds or headphones. They're owned by Samsung (via Harmon) and have as good sound and ANC, more form factor and color options, and are cheaper."
and still no MultiPoint.
"Looks dope , I'll upgrade from my current bud 3's"
"I know we like to rip on the stems for being too airpods-esque, but it really upgrades call quality coming from my buds 2 pro to the 3 pro. I hope the stems stay!"
"The best part of the buds fe was their old design.  Small, comfortable, stayed tightly in the ear due to the wings.  And now they are using this crappy design."
"I'm still waiting for them to do a good red pair again. I'm still rocking my Buds+ mainly because they still work, but partly because I loved the color of them and don't want to settle for a boring black or white or grey."
The 3 Pro's look like their from Temu.. So cheap looking.
Same
"wish I could buy the buds 2 pro for a decent price, I'd love to upgrade my base buds 2 and the 3s aint it"
"Really wish they made a new version, one that's tan or flesh colored with a matte finish.. The rose gold are good and don't stand out as much, but the glossy finish ruins it."
"they will do when apple changed their design

/uj the stem actually more useful to control volume and playback, it help the mic to receive clearer voice too, so I dont really mind with the stem design."
i prefer the stem because it makes controls way easier to use as well as balancing the weight distribution and fit so they don't fall out as easily.
Yeah. Apple copy cat.
"Yeah, me too, I'll stick with my old ones, I don't need everyone to see I got earbuds in, nice and subtle design that's not obvious is my preference.

As for control, only thing I do on my earbuds is play/pause - hardly ever change the volume while listening and if I want to change mode or volume I can easily do that on my watch or phone, no need to fiddle around with the buds themselves"
This is a downgrade
wouldn't that just look like a hearing aid though
"Ngl I disagree with the stem being better for controls, the tap contro was way easier than pinching"
Over the base bud 3 ? I'm having a few issues anyways.
Yeah the white ones blend in just fine for me
"I've used both, and the stem design is superior. Controls are more reliable and you get more types of controls."
"I've also used both, and I disagree. The stem design on the buds 3 pro falls out more compared to the wing design, and the pinch controls are harder to actually activate since you need to touch a specific area compared to only needing to tap a large surface"
This plus it just looks bad imho.
"Quite curious why 100+ inch televisions are still tens of thousands of dollars, despite 85-inch models being under a few grand for the latest models with the best panel technology. I‚Äôm going to assume the reason is either: intentionally high priced, gate kept and marketed to those with higher disposable income, or the yields per batch for panels beyond 100 inches are so incredibly low they have to charge 2010 new car prices. I‚Äôd be more interested in the profit margins on the range of TV sizes, I‚Äôm wondering which model makes the most money outside of ‚Äútotal units sold‚Äù."
"Could be worse, their [114‚Äù microLED costs $150,000](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/micro-led/114-class-micro-led-mna114ms1ccxza/)"
27K for a TV? 2025 really is a dystopian timeline.
"Part of it is that there's little demand for such big TVs. People's houses are only so big and so there is little need for TVs beyond 85"". If your house is so big that you need a 100+ inch TV, you're more likely to be able to afford the high premium for them. They're luxury items and priced as such."
"No 100 inch TVs are around a 2000 to 3,500 for a good one with local dimming, it's just that the bigger brands like Samsung and Sony overcharged for the same panel that TCL and Hisense are selling, because it's in their cabinet with their electronics and operating system solutions built-in. This is the exact same panel at TCL is selling in their 115 in because they made the goddamn panel they always make Samsung's panels for the past few years."
My jaw dropped when I saw it at the Samsung booth in CES
"On top of that, cable is 720p/1080i, Netflix and YT are mostly 1080p, and in order to use that TV as a PC monitor you need a 4090/5080/5090 build at minimum."
"understandably so. hope I can see one in person one day.¬†

definitely one of those things i‚Äôd buy if i was a billionaire.¬†"
You dont think a person who buys a TV for 27K cant afford a 4090/5080/5090? üòÖ
"Netflix is only 1080p on the lower subscriptions, but yeah broadcast TV looks like shit and has looked exactly the same since 2008."
Killer Blu-ray display though
"You never know brother  
I see people driving a brand new $100k Mercedes just to sell it after 2 months because they can't afford insurance and gas.  
People out here buying the newest PM iPhone or S ultra each year while living paycheck to paycheck, going to the grocery store and telling the cashier to write it down so they can pay later.  
Meanwhile some dude lives in a super tiny apartment driving a fully paid off Type R.  
You can never actually know."
"And for triple A titles like rdr2 or fh5. If you got $27k for a TV you probably have $6k to drop on a beast PC to enjoy high quality games on such an incredible TV. But as a pure TV for shows, massive waste for money."
"Interesting. I have a question (looking to buy first apartment): do you think its possible i buy too expensive of an apartment, then i need to sell it like that 100k Mercedes owner?  
  
Or can I always ""afford"" an apartment as long as the bank gives the the loan? I live in Norway for reference."
"You can live in your car  
You can't drive in your apartment"
Ok?
I can't wait to hear about Apple's incredible brand new folding screen innovation which is going to change the smartphone market.
Well I switched from the 16 pro max to Fold 7 and couldn't be happier. Samsung and Android have come a long way
">In 2014, Apple and Samsung were duking it out to rule the U.S. smartphone market. Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.

>It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.

>But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it‚Äôs all about the screen.

>In the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple‚Äôs market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.

>Apple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It‚Äôs often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.

>That‚Äôs one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung‚Äôs stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.

>Apple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.

>In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung‚Äôs catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge. 

>The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.

>One user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.

>In the past month, Samsung‚Äôs premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.

>The market share numbers aren‚Äôt just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.

>But Samsung‚Äôs gains also reflect the company‚Äôs ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung‚Äôs second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.

>Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy and Z phone lineup ‚Äústretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,‚Äù said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. ‚ÄúThere is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.‚Äù

>Samsung‚Äôs first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers ‚Äî including CNBC ‚Äî discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.

>But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.

>‚ÄúThere really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,‚Äù said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.

>The South Korean company doesn‚Äôt provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device‚Äôs predecessor by nearly 50%.

>‚ÄúSamsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,‚Äù said Bjorhovde. ‚ÄùTry to be ahead, show that something is different, and there‚Äôs a certain halo effect from that.‚Äù

>According to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung‚Äôs sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a ‚Äúslight boost‚Äù from the slim S25 Edge.

>Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google‚Äôs Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can‚Äôt get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.

>Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google‚Äôs circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they‚Äôd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.

>On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information."
I know that high level staff are sometimes choosing folding samsung phones instead of a new iphone -- because when I give them the option they are choosing the samsung.
"iPhone just feels the same ole.  

Very tempted to get the z fold 7."
Good. They got lazy. Comfortably complacent. I've owned *nearly* every iPhone. And now this my *third* Fold. It's exciting. It's inspiring. It's fresh. Apple needs to wake up and innovate. Something other than those expensive ski goggles they released.
"Iphone is meh nowdays... I do have 16pro and fold7, ios 26 is meh (beta) compare to what one ui8 is"
"

since i cant post here my self, where can i post if i have a problem with my phone?

My problem: My S21 FE has a touchscreen error, and now that it has been restarted, I can no longer enter my password.

To be precise, only the ‚Äú1‚Äù doesn't work.

Since the device requires the password once when booting up, this is really difficult.

An external keyboard doesn't work.

Rotating the keyboard doesn't work.

Making the keyboard smaller doesn't work.

Entering the number 1 at ""emergency call"" works, but cannot be copied.

any other ideas?  
i really dont want to buy a new display."
Can‚Äôt wait for Apple to invent the foldable
[removed]
"Apple faces a fundamental challenge if it wants its rumored iFold to compete with Samsung‚Äôs foldables: escaping the limitations of plastic polymer laminate displays. Unless Apple breaks that barrier, Samsung‚Äôs technology now on track for an eighth generation lead will continue to set the standard. Fortunately for Apple, Corning‚Äôs Willow Glass has existed since 2012, though so far it has been confined to R&D labs rather than mass production. For context, Samsung‚Äôs current UTG measures just 50 microns before protective layers and the titanium backing plate. Willow Glass, by contrast, can be manufactured as thin as 100 microns, which in theory offers a stronger foundation. If Apple wants to leapfrog rather than merely catch up, it will need to harness Willow Glass or an equivalent breakthrough before Samsung widens the gap even further.

I suspect Apple‚Äôs iFold will follow the same path as the Vision Pro: a slick, unmistakably Apple take on the category, loaded with polish and unique design choices. But arriving so late to the foldable race means it‚Äôs destined to remain an ultra expensive, niche product, one that appeals mostly to die hard Apple loyalists rather than reshaping the broader market."
Not taking over or sell more than.
"For all of the foldable faithfuls, I salute y'all for holding the line. I was almost tempted to get the Fold7 but I didnt want to trade my S24 for it"
Gotta wait for them to fail at ripping off the s25 edge first with the 17 air
And the sad truth is those who converted to samsung for the fold might actually go back to ios if apple ship its own foldable phone.
"The same way Apple made ""game changing"" giant screens with the iPhone 6 and everyone else follows."
Some rumors say that the screen for apple's upcoming foldable will be manufactured and provided by Samsung. It'd probably be the same display specs as the Z fold but some idiot apple fanboy will make it seem like such innovative technology.
Should be out within the next year or so. From mock ups it appears the flip doesn't even have a front screen.
"They should've saved ""liquid glass"" for the foldable üò≠"
"The sad part is it'll work.  The Apple sycophants will of course act like it's never been done before - or AT BEST it'll be the ""well, Apple finally perfected it!"" line - and those who just don't know about folders will absolutely believe Apple came up with it first.

Apple is practically a mind virus at this point for a lot of people."
rent free
One drop and it is useless
"It is amazing, but I have a tough time using it as the main device because I feel like I'm going to break it."
To be honest. I've had many Samsung and they are also get lazy and complacent. The fold has fallen behind their Chinese counterparts and the camera on the ultra series is getting old and I'm getting tired of it. Looking to try something new in 2 years.
There is countless bugs im tired of this shit phone. I miss android
"Have been using both (iPhone, Samsung). 

How do you coupling with Android Doze mode? 

Samsung skipped notifications, bcz Android sleep mode. When you screen is off (idk) - all it‚Äôs off ))"
"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, a 2025 foldable phone, offers a blend of innovation and practicality.¬†Its pros include a large, immersive screen, powerful AI capabilities, and a refined, lightweight design.¬†However, cons include a high price point and the potential for hinge and screen fragility.¬†The Z Fold7 is a top-tier foldable, but its unique features come with trade-offs.¬†Pros:

* **Large, Immersive Display:**The 8-inch main screen provides a tablet-like experience, ideal for media consumption, multitasking, and creative tasks.¬†
* **AI-Powered Features:**The phone's AI capabilities enhance photo editing, optimize performance, and potentially offer other intelligent features, as highlighted by the ""AI Photo Edits"" feature.¬†
* **Refined and Lightweight Design:**Compared to previous Fold models, the Z Fold7 is slimmer, lighter, and feels more like a traditional smartphone when folded.¬†
* **Enhanced Durability:**The device boasts improvements like a stronger hinge and thicker folding screen glass, suggesting increased durability compared to earlier foldable phones.
* **Long Battery Life:**The phone offers a ""long battery life,"" likely able to last a full day for moderate users.¬†
* **Versatile Camera System:**The 200MP main camera with Pro-Visual Engine ensures high-quality photos.¬†
* **Edge-to-Edge Display:**The wider cover screen, now at 6.5 inches, and the larger inner screen offer an expansive viewing experience, according to a YouTube review.¬†
* **Flex Mode:**Allows for hands-free video calls and other tasks by folding the phone at various angles.¬†

Cons:

* **High Price:**As a premium foldable device, the Z Fold7 is expected to have a high price tag.¬†
* **Potential for Hinge and Screen Fragility:**Despite improvements, foldable phones can still be more susceptible to damage than traditional smartphones, especially around the hinge area and folding screen.¬†
* **No S Pen Support:**Unlike some previous Fold models, the Z Fold7 may not support the S Pen.¬†
* **Camera Limitations:**While boasting a 200MP sensor, the camera system might lack a 5x telephoto lens, which some users may prefer.
* **Charging Speed:**The phone's charging speed may not be as fast as some users might expect, despite Samsung's branding.¬†
* **IP Rating:**The IP48 rating indicates basic water and dust resistance, but it may not be as robust as some users might prefer.¬†"
"They'll proudly exclaim that ""It's never been done before!""

....on an iPhone. üòÇ

As is tradition."
There‚Äôs been rumours of an iPhone 17 Air long before there were rumours of the S25 Edge
"Why is it sad, lol? This is such a weird take.

If someone prefers iOS over Android, why is it ""sad"" that they swap back when their preferences (foldable) are met on their preferred operating system (iOS)? It makes sense and isn't sad. People have different tastes and different use cases that make one better than the other."
"Hot take but that might be me. Ive had the Fold 5 since launch and love the device but Samsung really needs to polish One UI especially for the Fold series. 

Never been an Apple fan but have been growing on me after using an iPhone and iPad as back up devices.

It is unacceptable for me to spend $1500+ for a phone that has lag/visual lag and animations that the OS for some reason skips bc its under load.

If the Apple Fold comes out and almost all apps are optimized for the Apple Fold but not for Android Folds...man that really is unfair and unfortunate."
"What is sad about it lol? Some people just  prefer iPhones,."
"Yes, Samsung followed 3 years before with the release of the first Note"
Why would you drop your phone? What is wrong with you dude?
The base S cameras are even older
"Doesn't help that Samsung's camera software is insanely slow and sluggish too. Feels like I'm operating a device from *many* years ago.

My partner and I recently got a kitten and it's freaking impossible to take photos with my S24 Ultra because it's so slow at opening and taking the photo. Don't get me started on taking multiple photos while the last ones are processing in the background which grinds the phone down to a fucking halt."
Had Samsung phones for 25 years up to the S25U.  Switched to Vivo phones and never looked back.
"I don't know what Apple was thinking. One of the selling points of iOS was the ""refined software"", but they throw that down the board."
iOS 18 was a whole trojan horse of bugs and they still haven‚Äôt fixed half of it
"Never had any issues with notifications, fortunately"
"For specs, it IS thinner than the Samsung. So potentially yes, never been that thin before in the US‚Ä¶"
"Rumours, not releases."
"Lol, here we go...üôÑ"
You must have the S24 Ultra (Temu Edition) cause I don't deal with that.
I‚Äôm sure they used to be that way? I don‚Äôt know. I only went to Apple recently at 13. I now have a 16 and it‚Äôs gradually getting worse. I actually liked my 13 a lot but ever since they went to a certain iOS version (I don‚Äôt remember which one but they changed A LOT) it has been giving me problems. Now with the integration of AI I‚Äôm sure it didn‚Äôt help either. For personal reasons I just want to find a way to save iMessage history. Once I am able to do that I am moving to Samsung again and staying there.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more
"Nice to see this. 

Idk why my statement was disliked, but I have this issue on different Samsung devices.
It's a fact: on Android (Samsung) Google mail and Telegram notifications are delayed when the screen is off."
"Hmm maybe that‚Äôs to do with Apple‚Äôs September release schedule?? It‚Äôs not like Apples making a thin iPhone after 6 years like they are doing with the Fold next year.

Make fun of the Fold from Apple, that makes sense. The Air being 5 months later than the S25 Edge is minimal."
All right buddy. Why don't you go ahead and screen record while taking photos and we'll see just how beautifully your phone handles it?
"Not sure why you have this problem, if it would be standard it would be well known. Never had this issue."
That's fine by me. I don't really care lol.
"It's a wide spread issue 

For example, 

https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/s/dd5pYWGd1g

or

https://www.androidauthority.com/android-delayed-notifications-and-fixes-3487369/

I've used SGS 21, 21 Ultra, 23 FE, Note 20 for now (second phone). 
And all of them have the same delaying comparably with the iPhone. 

Have you used an iPhone before ?"
"I have iPhone as well as working phone, but 0 difference there. If I had that problem I wouldn't use samsung."
"Sound quality and noise canceling/transparency are better. 

Everything else is worse. I don't like the stems, the fit is noticeably less secure, battery life is bad, the new proprietary tips with the stupid interior plastic shells seem designed to get stuck/break. 

Kind of a mess. I switched to Pixel Buds Pro 2."
I feared this so i bought  a pair of sennheiser momentum 4s when I switched  so fat they've been great however i prefer the stem form factor i tend to go back to my nothing ear 2s as my daily driver id recommend the nothing ear 2s if you  want amazing sound quality there's a lot of reasons why I prefer android over apple but damn does apple make a great pair of earbuds
That's similar to other reviews I've read that point out the Buds 2 Pro were actually better in most aspect than the Buds 3 Pro. It's a weird backslide. Wonder if things were rushed to meet the deadline. Especially considering the initial problems they had on release.
"I'm kinda with you.

I had the Air Pods Pro 2 before the Buds Pro 3 (switched from Apple).
I am giving them a chance, but so far every time I put them in and go for a bike ride it's either totally windy or too much noise cancelling - no matter how much I try to adjust the noise cancelling..."
Buds 2 Pro gang still going strong! Got them for 99‚Ç¨ when 3 came out and I am still very satisfied.
I'll check them out.. Thanks
People these days get triggered too easily.
"Not to be the hater,  but i see almost no difference between me s8 + and the s10 +. I can't see what the tablets can offer ""more""."
Samsung should make a mini tablet between 8 and 9 inches.
Hopefully it still has an SD slot. There's no way I'm ever going to sign up for anyone's cloud service.
"I still have not found a use case for tablets. They can't do what my computer does. They can't go in my pocket like my mobile does. With the Samsung Fold I am using, I don't even need these tablets for the SPen feature."
Dimensity and not Snapdragon lol
"Did the S10+ and S10 Ultra not get One UI 8 updates?  Is that a selling feature for these new tablets because while they seem nice, don't seem massively different."
"If you can't post support questions here, then where do you post them?"
Just a new chip and an Anti Reflective coating. That's it.
Just upgraded processor and that's it. I have the S8+ and don't think I'll be upgrading for another couple of years
Theclast one got rid of the SD slot.
They're saving their stash for G Fold I guess.
"Yeah it sucks, No one makes real high end Android tablets for Americans to buy anymore, mediatek has horrific drivers for emulation, it's fine for most people but American enthusiast really have NO other options, everything else either has a mid LCD display or also a non flagship soc. It really sucks but Apple has a monopoly on the high end tablet market at this point."
Most people aren't going to notice a difference.
I'd say side grade not even upgrade really it's better in some ways but like 1/2 or 1/3 to performance and anything that uses custom drivers
Of course they would. They want me to pay extra for the 512 GB model they won't offer because they want me to use thier cloud servers to store my data to scan it for AI stuff and automatically delete my downloaded anime and music.
i read oneplus has a tablet with a beefy processer
Android and tablets don‚Äôt go well together and even if they did there‚Äôs not enough there to be competitive.

In all honesty congrats on the upgrade ü•≥ü•≥"
"Congratulations üëèüèΩüéâ I'm also a long time Active 2 user and it served me so well. It finally (kinda) kicked the bucket on me so I'm upgrading to a GW8 44mm. One day the screen just popped out fully on its own, dangling by the ribbon cable lol. It actually still works fine though but waterproofing is out of the window so I don't feel safe using it anymore."
"I'm a long time Samsung user, but I have never actually understood the watch concept. 

What is it needed for?

Like why do you need watches, if your phone displays all the same things? 

Blood pressure and saturation? Well, no, thanks, but monitors are way better and way more accurate, and it's not like I need it 24/7, and I doubt, that those who need will use watches for that.

What is the actual point in its existence?"
Grats! Use Watch 7 for 3 months. It's the best watch!
"It look really good, is it water resistant?"
I prefer my cassio
"My Galaxy Watch 5 went through the same shenanigans. I went to a local Smartphone repair shop and told them to use the same glue they use on smartphones. A year of gymming, some rain exposure and its still running so far."
"This was me before i got a watch lmao but after using one for alnost a year (Galaxy watch active 2) It really helped me in tracking my exercise, my sleep, and it vibrates or notify me when ive been sitting for too long or i need to drink water. I wear my watch all day and when i do my work i dont check my phone and put it in DND so i dont get distracted. Having the watch gives me limited but important notifications like new messages or calls. Not having to open the phone helps me not get sidetracked. Also im an active person and i really love using the watch with its sensors, im monitoring my running level to build up my stamina and endurance. Also i love the sleep coaching feature, it helped with my sleep and its not placebo too ive been waking up early full of energy, unlike last time even though with 9 hours of sleep i still feel groggy the whole day. It guided me mentally and physically, its more than an extension of your phone. And its not just about the things youve said there are a lot of features in samsung health. It's really useful for people with complications, for example if the watch detects you got an irregular heartbeat for awhile it notifies you thru your watch and your phone. Thats one thing good about it and theres a lot more feature"
"Who asked you? 

Be happy for the guy or be quiet."
"I would have done this, or even repaired it myself, but it isn't really worth doing for the Active 2 specifically. You can get them in grade A condition for around ¬£30 nowadays (honestly insane because it is still a very good watch). The price to repair it would most likely not justify it."
Thank you for the detailed explanation ü§ó
Yep that's more than fair XD
same thing happened to my active 2. screen popped off and I got lazy about reglue -ing it so it must have had a micro rip. bought a new active 2 and meant to throw away the broken one... accidentally threw out the replacement. jumped the gun and got a 6c
"""...accidentally threw out the replacement.""

Oh no üò≠ü§£ - At least you got a major upgrade out of it, that's a massive leap"
"I've owned:

1. Galaxy Nexus (2012 - 2014)
2. Galaxy A52 4G (2021 - 2023)
3. Galaxy S23 (2023 - present)

And I've never had a single reliability issue with any of them. Between the Galaxy Nexus and the A52 I had a Nokia Lumia 930 and two mid range Huawei phones, which were much worse in terms of reliability. But with Samsung, I've always had a flawless experience with every single device I bought (I'm deep into the ecosystem with Galaxy A55 as my work phone, Galaxy Book4 Edge, Buds 2 Pro, Buds FE, Galaxy Watch 7 44 mm, and the Neo QLED 90D TV)."

This is by far my favourite Samsung I have owned...battery life for days, life was so much simpler back then. At the time this was on BT Cellnet (UK) and their 'family and friends' package gave you 10 free mobile numbers which included 1 international and I used this for about 8 years. I then went all-out Sony Ericson (Walkman phones) till my galaxy S2 and upgraded to the S4 (which upset me due to the bit warranty debacle as I was an android power user), currently own the S25 ultra fully stock"

Samsung galaxy M21. I still use it as my daily driver and it does everything

It actually has good daylight camera, 48mp is amazing and front camera is actually too good, you will understand if you use this phones camera once.

Decent processor(runs codm at 40 fps and PUBG at 50 ish fps, all at lowest graphics)

And it has a huge battery even after 5 years of heavy usage it still gives me 6-7 hours of SOT easily.

It has a headphone jack.

It‚Äôs actually lightweight like only 188 gms, it‚Äôs actually the most lightest phone in the world with 6000mAh lithium ion battery(do note I said lithium ion, nowadays some Chinese phones are 185 gms but they have Silicon carbon batteries)"
S5 was the perfect phone

Def the S10 5G for me. It lasted years before encountering any issues. I got my mom A52s and it has no problem even till now.
J7 prime.
My s25 is perfect
Note 8. Loved that phone
"I've had Samsung phones my entire life, and not a single one had had any issues
 
The phones I've had over the years:
- Galaxy Trend pluss
- Galaxy S4 (Passed down)
- Galaxy J5 2017
- Galaxy S7 (Passed down)
- Galaxy S21
- Z fold 4
- S23 Ultra (12gb ram)
- Z fold 7 (16gb ram, Just got today)

The only thing I've done to any of the phones was changing the screen protector on my fold 4 after 2 years, which was free. 
Still got all the phones at home, and they all still work, except the trend pluss that most likely had a bad battery (given the age of the phone, it's acceptable)."
"My wife's s6 edge long time ago was caseless and would always be dropped to the floor and in rough cement and asphalt. I swear we've dropped it hundred times because of how slippery it is. This includes the multiple times my daughter would throw it when she was 1. Ultimately we gave it to someone and she lost it during her commute. It lasted almost 4 years of rough use and it only has a few scuffs on the side and the glass was intact and pristine. Now, my note 20u is more than 4 years old and still rock solid"
Galaxy note 10.
Note 10+
"Note 3.   Four years of owning it and it still could do everything I needed for apps.  Only reason I got rid of it was because it didn't have the Tmobile new long range bands and I felt it during a trip to northern Michigan where I had to roam on AT&T network even tho tmobile had towers there, they just had the new bands only."
"My current phone, A25 5G. Everything is perfect except I just wish the under-screen fingerprint would come back. The power button is mistakenly clicked at least 5 times a day"

"I‚Äôve owned 

Wave 2 

Galaxy Fit

S22+ (currently)

Never faced any issue with any of these models always sold them on OLX after using like 5-6 years and it fetched me somewhere around 500-1500 rupees."
S4
"As a samsung user for many years, i would say any S series (flagship) level‚Ä¶ as its performing very well, camera is great and can last for many years‚Ä¶"
"Note 9 was probably the best. I currently have the S22 Ultra, which died on me, a Samsung first (owned about 8 of their flagships including the Galaxy S1). Fortunately, Samsung fixed the phone which was 2 years past warranty, free of charge."
"Was my S9, but after 4 years with S21+, I am gonna go with that one."
"Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro, was like a tank, only weakness was it's battery that was toast after waiting in the drawer for too long."
"Other than my S5 from 2014, none of them afterwards were unreliable. My S9+, Tab S4, S20+, Tab S7+, S23 Ultra, Tab S10 Ultra, Galaxy Gear 2 Neo, Galaxy Gear S3 Classic, Galaxy Watch 3 Classic and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic have yet to fail me.¬†"
"In my case the s9 is the only phone I've ever used where the display went blank, stopped working completely. Everything else worked, including touch, but the display just died. Had to hook up to a PC and use DEX to access phone. In all fairness though the phone was gifted to me secondhand, and the rear cover had been replaced."
"I've owned:

4. Galaxy S24 Ultra 512Gb (2024 - present)


Not a single problem with them, just 2 broken screen's with the S2 and 1 broken screen with the S9+, all my fault ü§™

Replaced 1 battery at middle time too with both S2 and S9+.

Galaxy S25 Ultra  -  New (We will see)"
Samsung Galaxy A5 2017
"Well, my note9 has lasted me 7 years so far with pretty heavy use and zero problem. Never cracked the screen even though its been dropped too. Only problem i had was that the s pen would break INSIDE of the phone if it got dropped which.....is a bit odd to me but whatever. My iphones never lasted this long so i find this pretty impressive and for sure am down to drop 1k+ on one of their mainlines again. It seriously is only starting to show signs of age now, actually impressive."
"S7 Edge, despite the curved edge screen still being a relatively new innovation at the time, the phone was built quite well. Had it for 7 years, before starting to see signs of slow performance. If they ever provided 7 years OS updates to S7,S8,S9,S10 lineup, they could've gone forever in my opinion."
"S3 (T-Mo/T999). Put it through the washer twice (I was 8 and left it in my pocket) and it still worked after everything.

A55. Lost the phone jack but still have 1tb flash drive
"My S7 Edge lasted 5 years, survived multiple drops, and only started to be slightly slow at the end. Battery life was still incredible and I didn't have a single other issue. Replaced because I got a new phone as a graduation gift but I'm convinced that phone would still be working now 4 years after I traded it in, absolute beast."
Without a doubt my S23U. Two years and a half years in now and it's still running perfectly. Dropped multiple times and still looking fine except a few small knicks in the back glass. Never had a phone last longer than 18 months before!
Note 10+  2019-2022
"Note10. 

I'm still using it and the only thing wrong is that it need a new battery."
"Galaxy S8


The eternal Android phone that they finally killed.


Before that, the last Smasnug I has was the D500 and I had one of the later ones without the screen ribbon decay. I think I had that for like 4 years!"

Note 10+. Still acts brand new
My S21 Ultra has been a daily workhorse for years now.
"Haven't really had reliability issues with phones but my Galaxy A50 I've been using from 2019 has been rock solid, no issues whatsoever. Still not sure when I'll upgrade, this one just gets the job done for most of anything I want to do."
"I use a Galaxy Note 9 8/512 cloud silver as my main one and an A34 6/128 for work.
I love Samsung and Good Lock so much
One UI 7 was a huge improvement being able to resize widgets even more on tablets
After 4 years, the Galaxy Note needs to be charged about twice a day, but it still does about 18% per hour using YouTube and opens the Samsung Internet faster than the A34 for example
I intend to buy the s23U and leave the note 9 for dex use"
That's my phone!
Every one of them!
"Note 9 for me. I still have it as a backup to my folds. I wanted a non american one that did not have snapdragon processor, so i could root it"
"galaxy s7. my uncle uses his since launch, hasn't ever replaced battery or anything, no issues, and benefitting from the expandable storage with a micro sd card."
My s24 ultra has been my best. I got the 25 and went back to the 24 because I needed Bluetooth spen üòÇ
"Samsung Galaxy S5, the one I have has seen a lot of stuff over the years. First was used by my father, then by my grandma and then by me. It died in 2022 but came back to life out of nowhere in 2023 and has worked just fine since then."
"Probably the S24 Ultra I have right now. 

Previous A80 had crap battery, camera mechanism glitched. Previous J7 pro used to freeze."
"A54 is after 2 years brand new,i also had s25 base,scratches around frame from dust"
old S20FE's holding up like champs
"Galaxy S24, its insanely fast.
S21 fe, was pretty fast, the camera just wasnt too great and some other stuff was meh
Note8 was a great phone while I used it and I loved using it, sadly the screen broke at some point and the thing became really slow, played a lot of minecraft on it
A20e was really slow but one of my first real android phones, played a lot of minecraft on it"
I got an s20 when it came out and the screen just died a couple of weeks ago. Just got the s25+.
"Honestly, my household have had something like 5 Samsung phones and they've all been reliable."
"Galaxy M30s (M series phone are only sold in India so u might not know it) but its a 145 dollar phone bought in oct 2019 and its still functional and good for day to day task as well as light gaming like COC,brawl stars i can even play cod mobile on it at 55-50fps constant it has a 6000 mah battery so its a powerhouse altho over the years the battery has degraded to 5400mah but still lasts me 6-7 hrs of screen time."
"The Note 8 was incredible for its time. I had one for nearly 5 years.

My current phone is the S25 Ultra. I hope it will last long too"
Samsung SGH-X426
Note 9 was the best and my favorite phone I've ever had
Samsung Galaxy A54. It's survived 17+ and more probably drops. 7 car tires. And 4 drops into water. Still running strong as ever.
Been using a50 for the past 6.5 years. Just needed a battery change that too after 4 years of heavy use. Still runs like new.
Note 10+
"I had a A52s 5G which I used from January 2022 to December 2024 after which it was still running perfectly with no issues and nearly perfect physical condition. I gave it to my sister, hopefully it keeps trucking on in her hands...

I'm now on an S22 Ultra which I bought used (through Koodo) in December, which is working fine. Sometimes it seems like 2 small regions of the screen don't register the stylus tip as well (not an issue for me) but that was happening ever since I first got it. So far so good.

In the past I had an iPod touch 5 which worked from 2014 to 2017 or so where I think it overheated; and an iPhone 6 from 2017 which is working to this day, also in great physical condition. I stopped using it in 2019. Both super jailbroken and modded. Also have a Xiaomi Mi A2 which, besides the random bootloops it sometimes gets for no fucking reason, is still in perfect condition that I used from 2019 to 2022.

So the bottom line is, I don't think it's specific to Samsung. Take care of your devices and they will probably be fine. I've never done a battery replacement because I slow charge and don't use it while charging; always used a case, still careful never to drop my phones; and idk be gentle I guess."
Galaxy 9.  It's the last Samsung phone I've had without any major issues.
"Galaxy S2 - had it for 5 years.  i loved it and only upgraded as more apps were no longer supported and webpages started to slow.

Galaxy S7 - a huge improvement over the S2, however the Battery SWELLED and i had to replace within a year.

Galaxy S8 - Phenomenal phone.  TOP TIER Design.  Solid casing, perfect size, and that beveled edge?  the S8 is the pinnacle of phone design.  i still use it for some apps because it's weight and size is seriously perfect.

Galaxy S24Ultra - i couldn't replace the S8 for years bc i was too in love with it. (my god what a great piece.) but the S24U won me over with it's return to softer design features.  the size is a little large, and the corners are a little pronounced, but it's streets ahead of the modern competition -- and most importantly (i guess) it RUNS SO SMOOTH."
S10+ was probably the best phone I have ever owned. Wish I could go back in time and telle to hold on to it longer. I have the s24 ultra now and I genuinely really like it but the s10 was amazing.
S9+
"S20, still going strong. I might get S26U or wait for S27U, probably dont want to wait until S28U lol"
S24+. I traded it for an iPhone 16 pro and immediately regretted the decision so swapped that for a pixel 9 pro XL. I miss my 24+.
"To be fair, it's just a cheap A16 5G. I just got it recently. It's my first Samsung phone and I just wanted to try a cheap phone. I went with this cheap phone ($200 from Samsung directly) because it comes with 6 years of updates.

That bodes well, or at least optimistic, but I am not 'hard' on phones. I'm not a heavy user. So, hopefully, it will last.

My only real complaint is that it lies to me about the charging time. It seems to assume I've already bought the charging brick for the high speed charging. That was not included in the box. I've yet to buy one, though I might as well. Dirty thing is a liar...

Anyhow, my last phone was an old LG that survived years of use. I'm looking for a new family of devices to buy into, which was also why I went cheap. I can afford a much fancier phone and may do so, but I first want to feel the company out.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. This is my first Samsung phone. I think I've had some Samsung appliances in the past, like a stereo or something like that back in the day. We'll see how it goes."
"Samsung a73, reliable in multitasking and competent in Games/photos, as it will still have support for Android 16 and security until 2027, my noble warrior will stay with me until then"
"Samsung Galaxy S3

It was a beast back in the day, loved that phone."
"Samsung S10, still runs good to this day."
Galaxy A52s - 2021 - present
"Galaxy S21+, still works."
"The only Galaxy phone I ever had any issues with was the S6 that just suddenly died (can happen to any phone - the mobo irreparably fried itself while I was using Google maps).

I have never had any issues with any of the Galaxy devices I've had over the last 12 years, except for minor ones that were eventually fixed with software updates. It's one of the main reasons why I continue to use Samsung devices as my primary phones."
Galaxy S3. One of the best phones i ever owned!
Note 10+. 5 years and still going well. One battery replacement.
Ironically my fold 3 i treated that thing horribly and it survived longer than any other phone I've ever owned lmao
"I only had S20 FE from Samsung and it's the most reliable phone i've ever used, still rocking it after 5 years!!!"
"Galaxy S8, bought it at launch date and still works for basic tasks today."
"galaxy s7 edge, my dad got it from his work then gave it to me 4 years after. Still using it for spotify and quick notes, only swapped the batteries but besides that it still works"
A Galaxy S24 plus. The last ten years of kinks has been worked out.
"To date, my S20 FE.  Which ironically bricked itself about 3 weeks ago."
"I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note 9. It had eye sensor so I didn't have to remove my mask (I work in a hospital), was fast, S-pen, & good battery life."
"my s10e was perfect, one ui 7 nuked my s23 though. kinda pissed about it."
"My S9. It was a work phone at the time, bought it outright from them when I left, and until now, it has become my 4k Webcam using NDI, and it still goes albeit with a near dead battery now."
S9 still holding upüôå
"Note 9, note 21u"

"Galaxy Tab 7.7 2013 - 2018
Galaxy A32 4G 2021 - now

My Galaxy A32 has survived 4 different water accidents and multiple countless drops even after all that it is still going strong and still usable"
"S duos it was my first phone 
I used it for 7 years it was at a time where software updates was rare since I only had limited internet access. Anyways the phone had battery issue so I replaced it and it's still working.
Then I switched to lg G3 then OnePlus 8pro (got green line 2 times)  and now iam using S23ULTRA... Since it's samsung iam waiting to see if I can break that old record of mine."
"S23 Ultra/S24 Ultra

I say this as they went from the garbage that was the S22 Ultra with so many issues and a battery life that was an absolute joke to something that was So much faster, battery life that matched Apple's best and stable performance."
"S7 Edge. My parents had to since launch, but kept a case on it. However, about 4 years ago I took the case off of it, dropped it hundreds of times, abused it, and it still runs perfectly. I installed a one UI 4 ROM and use it as a media player at home now because of the SD card slot."

S10 plusü´†
"Me:
1. Samsung Galaxy J2 Core (2019- 2023)
2. Samsung Galaxy A23 (2023- 2025)
3. Samsung Galaxy M16 5G (2025- present)

The J2 core was a hand me down from my mom, I managed to maintain it since I was still in school, it wasn't a bad phone, it was good during that time, no lags, responsive to basic apps until late 2022 to early 2023 (i still have it til today its just in my closet I dont use it)

My A23 was a big upgrade for me, because during that that I got my first job and I firstly prioritized a phone first since I needed an upgrade then slowly upgrading and forming an ecosystem (tablet + watch + laptop) 

M16 5G, works perfectly for me, a bit more faster than the A23 and lighter weight so pockets don't feel heavy.

Works perfectly for me üëå"

My current Galaxy S24+ would have been a close contender if it wasn't for that UI 7 killing my battery thing."
S9 with a custom rom planning to move to moto
"S8 Active. Bombproof, but with legit specs."
"Samsung Galaxy M21 (SM-M215F) 4/64 variant. Excellent battery(Still gives 7-8hrs SOT), Great camera and display.

Bought in June 2020 for 12k INR no problems till date just screen died so I switched to Samsung Galaxy M35 which is really awesome for the price (bought at 13K INR for 8/128 variant).

Thinking of replacing the screen on the M21."
Samsung s10(still using it now)
"**My S10e G970F/DS. 128GB/6GB. Popped a 256GB SD card in there too to keep music on.**

I had ""upgraded"" to an S24 B/DS and actually find that phone to be inferior in just about every way... After owning it for 4 months I'm just going to sell it. Each update made it worse, removed features, or made it slower....bah.

Not only does my s10e work... It just works better than my S24.  
It is thinner, Smaller, lighter and better shaped for the hand.  
The display is sharper ( higher PPI - and I find it has less black crush)

In my testing around my house, at car and motorcycle shows, snapping moving objects, the S10e is over all more sharp with better edge definition and contrast in its images. The S24 is soft, and washed out by comparison. The s10e while often over saturated, still gets the over all color feel of a scene closer to reality than the washed out photos the S24 takes. This is not even Hyperbole : look up the test photos on GSM arena. In good lighting the S10e is WAY sharper...and in low lighting is nearly as good as the 5 year newer phone.

The OS is hands down better : I actually find that many apps are MORE responsive on my S10e, than on the much newer more powerful S24...One UI7 was a disaster for me and removed many features I consider requirements ( such as non grouped notifications...) Heck, even android auto is more responsive when using my S10e. I have never been so disappointed with a phone before as I am with the S24.

The Galaxy S8 was my first big boy/most reliable phone ever yo
Note 7
M31s  still perfectly works after 5 years.
All of them
Honestly all the S line since Galaxy i9000/original S1 I've used have been extremely reliable. None of them broke on me.
I used a S5 before switching to apple. I do miss the phone quite a bit
I have only own the S series. S3. S4. S5. S7 edge. S8 plus. S10 plus. Then jumped to S24U. To me they are all reliable.
S10 and S21U were workhorse.
"I m using my Note 9 sind 2019. I ve changed the battery, the Fingerprint-sensor and the camera lense... Still rocking it...

Other then that no issues..."
"My s10, it did whatever I needed it to, like running old APK's something which my s24 can't do for some reason"
F23 most unreliable¬†
"Currently on S25U. Had a S3 and that phone was a gem. Dropped it by mistake from 2nd floor of a building and that didn't do anything to the phone. The battery just came out of the encasing, I put it back and it was ready to go."
Galaxy S II was *chef‚Äôs kiss*
Note 4 and S5
I would say the Samsung note 8. Mines still running strong .
"Note 10+

Got it new in fall of 2019 & traded it in for my S25 Ultra in Jan 2025."
"All of them, never had any issues with any of my Samsung phones.

S5 mini -> S8 -> S21 Ultra -> S24 Ultra"
"My S5+ from 2016 still works, and I only bought a new phone last year. Occasionally I turn the old one on to see how's it doing."
A25 has been amazingly good. Super cheap and does everything I want. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever restarted it and the battery life is incredible.
S24 Ultra. Built like a tank
The s4 mini was built like a dang nokia
Note 9 is still going.  Sadly it looks like I'll be forced to replace it soon Since it won't run some apps anymore.
"SMsung M35

Primary Device and Heavy Usage from the last 5 years 

Still runs smoothly including Fngerprint Sensor & No much Battery Drainage 

TRULY MONSTER"
"Dude i got the A21 for my mom, i thought itd be alright just based on the specs, atleast useable 

The A21 is complete trash. I have never interacted with a worse phone in my life. Like literally you will have a better experience with one of those phones you can buy at the dollar store"
"Reliable in terms of software and some hardware but not cheap and delicate display in samsung budget smartphone, i changed 3 times display when display was going purpule withour any damage, pressure and water damage."
"Note 10+ loved it, done all I needed it to. The 24U is a good 2nd tho."
"I've never had a Samsung break including Nexus devices
.. until I had 2 folds and a flip. All broke with 18 months."
Galaxy S20FE and Galaxy A73 5G.
Mine is the Galaxy S8. It's now my DeX/youtube machine after retiring it last year and replacing its battery fairly recently. I am currently on a Galaxy A25 and it's as reliable as it can be üòä
I've had 2 and my s22 ultra died so it would have to be note10+
Galaxy S7........and still the best I have ever used
Used 3 phones all are perfect.
"J7 2016 still lives to this date, git a new polarcell battery. Works as wifi station"
S23 Ultra
"If you consider beyond smartphones, Samsung x680 was a flip phone I had from 2006-2013. 7 years and the battery is still solid. I am 90% sure it will still work if I still can find it."
"I have had a lot 

Jet, S2, S7, S9, Note 10+ , z flip 3, z flip 5,z fold 6.

The S2 was the only one I ever had to send flt repair for signal issues (to twice, came back with the wrong android version flashed on it somehow)

My z flip 3 had batter issues after over 2 years but that's about it."
I'm still using my S9+ and it works completely fine. It does lag a bit but it's smooth most of the time.
Galaxy phones are all good except the flip and the fold. I had nightmares with those curved screen phones. Garbage.
"I have had the S23U since its release date. The battery life is still excellent and is not showing any signs of slowing down. I know that it probably is but not in
An obvious way. Best phone I‚Äôve had for performance and battery life."
"I bought the OG Galaxy S back in 2011, and still boots but has been in my drawer for a LONG time now.

Still using a S8+ since 2017 and still looks/works like new (save for it's awful battery)"
"For me, my a34 5g, j5, and j6. But best performance s22 ultra"
"Never had issues with my Samsung, but my s7 and s20fe where probs my best. I had the s7 for way longer than I should have and still had no issues, even the battery still held a good charge by the end of the day. S20fe ran games fine with no issue but had a noticeable decline in battery life after 3 years.

My current s22 is probs the worst I've had due to it being a downgrade in most practical ways to the s20fe. Smaller screen, can barely run games on anything over the lowest setting due to the eu version using Samsung processor not the snapdragon, the camera, dispite being ina case and its a seal panel has dust INSIDE the lense(???) and can't focus on upclose stuff and the battery after 8 after light us while I'm at work is at 40~%. Oh and no audio ports, mem card expansions, nothing."
S23 +
Note 9
Probably my s10+ bought in 2019 and it is still going strong.
"Note 20! Probably wouldn't still have it today if I could.

Still have my old S10+ that works."
"samsung galaxy note 3 neo, that thing lasted like almost 10 years and my father just changed his phone a few months before the big covid outbreak"
"A52s 5g

So good. I considered buying a spare as it currently gets delisted.

Just exceptional value for money"
Galaxy S2 T-Mobile US variant. Had a bunch of them and flipped them when. I knew a co worker that had one for years.
Galaxy J7 Nxt
Probably my s24 ultra
"The S21 Ultra, the Snapdragon variant."
"Every year Galaxy S phones get better and better. Especially since S6. I own the S23+ now. I am for sure, the next one will even be better if they keep (snap)Dragon alive. If you know what I mean.."
Longest I have before the motherboard bombed was the A52 (LTE variant).
F62. Bought it in 2021 and still going good.
"I had the Note8, Note10, S20 Ultra, ZFold2, and a S21Ultra. Every single one of them broke between 12-18 months. Maybe it was just bad luck but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Galaxy S10
"Personally, for me, it was the A71.  A brilliant phone for the time with a decent camera :)"
"One thing for sure, Samsung phones will have issues after 3-4 years of use. On the other hand, I have pixel 2,3 still running smoothly after 7-8 years of use. If you don't mind replacing phone after few years, go with samsung. If you want to use it for over 5 years, buy pixel phones. I have s22 now and it has battery issues. Getting battery replaced in few days for 3k"
I still have my S10+. The last of its kind to have a headphone jack
"My S22U exynos is still going strong at 3+ years. No issues at all.

I had an A5 that had a battery swell and pop the screen off, but Samsung replaced the guts, and the thing lasted a good 5 years. (Gifted it to a friend, and the thing just kept going and going.)"
Probably the galaxy S7
Galaxy Note 8. 7 years old. My Dad still uses it.
"Honestly Id say the current state of android is more stable than old android versions, so when speaking on overall reliability id say current models that still get updates, my S23U is pretty damn reliable, battery life is my only issue, even though its not particularly bad at all.


Based completely on hardware, I really loved my old Galaxy Note, it was reliable."
Galaxy S9 plus
"Got my galaxy s7 in 2016 and its still completely fine done me a good 9years, just the battery dies alot faster, just upgraded to the s25 ultra massive upgrade lmao"
"Note 9 - since 2018
S23 - since 2023"
"Not a flagship but the Galaxy M51 actually did a solid for me. Used it for almost over 4 years and its still going strong, although I moved on to the OP 13R, I'm still using it as a secondary and its going good."
"Galaxy Nexus, my one true love üíû"
"I have none. Two of my Notes died within 2 years. Surprisingly, my Tabs S6 has been running good since the first day I got it until now."
Samsung galaxy star pro 2014 - still switchs on
Samsung S10+
"The Galaxy A70 surprisingly, the battery lasted forever. I managed to get 12 hours sot once. The back panel did eventually fall off but other than that it was good. S23 on the other hand.... recently got the pink line, S911U1 variant."
"Galaxy A5 2017, back in 2018 till 2023. Has been very good, I've changed only because it was getting old (I change my phone generally every 4/5 years), and the battery wouldn't last much. But performance speaking, apart for some small stuttering here and there (not too frequent, anyway), it was working good!

My next phone (and the actual one) is a Galaxy A33 and, well... had been a nightmare. It lags; when the display get a little wet from sweat the touch goes crazy (which you could argue is normal, but A5 never experienced that); when it's hot outside it lags even more and when I'm in a hurry it seems to lag on purpose to bother me... I know, I know, it's A series, but...

Edit: grammar; English it's not my first language"
"S9 is the only answer, a beast"
I had a J5 (2017) which was an absolute beast. It was the first metal-back phone I ever owned and it was brilliant.
S25 Ultra and maybe my S7 Edge and S8+
A51(4G). 5 years and still going strong. Only the original battery life has reduced. There is no lag whatsoever. Can play games without FPS drops.
My s20 FE 5g was the best.
"My galaxy s9 - still have it around, been with me to hell and back and dropped many times and had ali express replacement parts - still works"
"galaxy A42 5G, i've had an A40 and an A33 too, both of those weren't doing well but the A42 is still doing great"
"had shitton of them (every generation and major model since 2019 except M series, it was work related), my all time fav is Note20"
"Galaxy s4 mini still working as new with LineageOS, replaceable battery, plastic back cover and scratch-free screen (i've used screen protector for a long time). It has NFC and all other things that needs to be in the modern smartphone"
"I got the S22 Ultra at launch. Two years later, it fell from the 3rd floor, bouncing off multiple stairs, and somehow survived with only a single line of dead pixels across the screen. I thought it would be completely destroyed (front and back cracked, frame bent), but no...it was fully functional. I sent it to warranty, and they replaced the frame (which only had minor dents from normal use), gave me a brand-new screen and a new battery, all free of charge.

Recently, I took it to the beach and put it in my slightly damp shorts (something I‚Äôd done many times before with no issue), but this time it got moisture inside (the seal was not correctly applied during the repair). I sent it back under warranty again, and it‚Äôs actually being repaired right now üíÄ

This is the most durable samsung i ve owned. All because of their flawless warranty that is."
Guru 1200
Not touched one since s3 lol.
"Samsung Galaxy Note 7...... said no one, ever"
"Well,I have used this phone. Mine was blue and the display was dull in reality. Rear cameras were good ,especially the main 48mp camera. Performance was just ok and I never played any kind of games."
All of them have been great *except* the notorious Fold4. Overall best might be the Fold3 as my S23 Ultra has been reliable from a hardware standpoint but needs rebooting more often due to random buggy operation.
samsung galaxy a6 plus (2018-2024)
"Samsung A3 2017 - present. It's small, light and has an¬†IP68 dust and water resistance rating. Droped it several times from around meter high - not a scratch.

Battery used to last for more than a week, now it's around 5 days."
"A52s. I've dropped it on asphalt, the screen is scratched, the back cover peels off when I take the case off. Despite all that, I still wash it with water and OneUI 7 runs somewhat smoothly on it. Gcam makes the most out of the midrange sensor. The community has made many configs and roms over the years, but with OneUI 8 locking the bootloader, I don't even know if such reliability would be possible anymore.

P.S. The plastic is so worn I can open the sim tray with my fingernail like on a Sony, and it has a headphone jack. What not to love about this.."
"My first samsung was samsung SGH-R210s. Loved that phone, blue screen."
None. Only used a J7 mini when it was already outdated.

"A50, still a beast after 6 years. Holds still more than 24 hrs"
Galaxy S3 which i used for like 3 years then pass it to my mother and she used it for like 2 more years then Galaxy S8+ it lasts for 5 years.
My galaxy s2 epic 4g touch seemed indestructible. I dropped it so many times and it would bust into peices sending the battery down the road but it never broke or gave me any issues.  I eventually upgraded to a galaxy s7 after many years and it did not hold up as well.

I've never had an unreliable samsung. I just upgrade out of boredom iguess

"Galaxy S4 , swapping batteries, custom ROMs outta the yang , and mostly wifi jacking in public when my prepaid data ran out. Easy to swap parts. Not water proof but came back with rice. At the time was a Swiss knife of phones and plenty of them"
"I had an S4 Active. That phone was built like a tank. one of the first rugged, waterproof phones in the market. it was a gorgeous textured metallic blue too.

after that, the note 9. still use it when my pixel acts up. truly the best designed phone to date. everything just makes sense with it. im sad it doesn't get updates anymore. such a solid phone with a beautiful display."
"Note 4, Note 9 and S23 Ultra (my current)."
"S3 6 years, s9 6 years, s24 ultra probably also 6 years. In conclusion i get the newest one every 6 years"
S7 and S9 plus. I still use the S7 for various things. And a family member used a launch day S9 plus daily until just a few months ago. The front speaker died.
"Technically my A54. Great mid-range phone from Samsung and could do all I needed without hardly any effort. Only problem at the time was that the battery was already showing serious wear. I had replaced it on my own with another battery bought from Amazon but unfortunately, that battery was garbage way past the time I even got it as that was showing signs of less charge holding properly. So ultimately I got rid it if it for a Motorola Edge 2024 (that was sold after 9 months as that phone lacked badly)."
I got my Galaxy S9 in 2018 and I've been using it this whole time. Just replaced it with the Z flip 7 a few days ago. The S9 started lagging a bit a year ago but otherwise was fine and reliable

"My Galaxy Note 2. Screen shattered a few times when it slid out of my sweatpants pocket and was still usable. I used it from 2013 to 2016, got a Note 5 as a gift that later had screen defects, and went back to the Note 2 in 2017 until 2019. I still used it for music back when I had the Note 5. 

The only reason I quit using it was because it got knocked off a table and the screen started getting dark until it turned black. I never fixed the screen after the first time it shattered as it was still usable.

Changed the battery cover, S-Pen, and battery out once. It's my favorite phone since the iPhone 4. I've considered putting a new screen on it."
"Galaxy s1 lasted me the longest, Galaxy s9 lasted me the second longest, Galaxy s23 is my current. I've used an A device before, forget which one but it was just mediocre."

"S9+ or Note10+ 5G have to be my favourites which had no issues üëå Well except for my Note10+ display breaking but thats not on the phone, thats on me haha

Both were absolute work horses, Note10+ wins by just a bit because it was probably my 2nd favourite ever phone design from Samsung (S7 edge wins by far for me) and also got me an ultrawide and 5G on a phone for the first time. Software had nothing to fault really on either, first time I didn't consider a custom ROM on my phone if that means much lol"

"Note 9 for me. It was a beast of a phone for it's time. Last of the fingerprint sensor on the back, at least for the s series. 6.4 inch screen ! Massive back then.

"Honestly, galaxy grand duos, my mom bought it in 2012 (as far as I remember) and used it until 2017, I used it from 2017 to 2019 and my cousin had it until 2021. I never had any problems with it even if it was already 5 years old when I got it, of course it was lacking on specs when I upgraded from if, but that phone worked for almost a decade with all original parts and was put out of use for lack of storage. I now have an S22 and plan on keeping it for at least another 2 years, maybe 3 (if Samsung lauches a mini from the S line all bets r off and I'm switching immediately though)."

S10 lite between 2020 and 2021.
"I have only used 3 and they just behave like they should (A52s/S20FE/S23U).

What you consider reliable?

Most samsungs, even entry models have amoleds nowaday, and phones with screens that can die from a fall despite being having case/screen protectors (cause the flex ""unglue"") are not something i'd call reliable per se.

Still have my mix 2s, mix 3 working ok, rooted, without that knox fuse crap. I'd still have my F3 if i wouldnt have lost it.

Battery wise, all those above have gone to shit, so is not something brand related but wear related."

But the fold 2 is probably my most favorite thing I ever bought.  Wish I could get the newest."

Dropped it in a lake and found it because the flash turned on 
Dropped it in a puddle of mud at spring awakening
Dropped it numerous times on the concrete and hardwood floors and has never shattered. I do have a case, but never had a screen protector. 

Still going strong from the looks of it."
Samsung S7. Still in use to this day. Only on the second battery.
"Probably my S6 Edge+, I used it until 2022 when the battery died."
"Samsung galaxy j5. Used that guy for six years. Stopped using 3 years ago because of too much lagging, but still useable. The only issue is the battery. If i replaced the battery, that guy might still work."
"S20 FE 5G without a doubt. It's the best phone I've had in a long time. It has managed to cover absolutely all the needs and everything I was looking for in it. He died because a lot of water got into him.

But it was the best phone I've had in a long time. The 4 best years of my life.

Right now I have the S25 ULTRA but come on, on an emotional level and mobile use, the S20 FE 5G was incredible for me.

Dropped it caseless hundreds of times ‚Äì never cracked once. Ran smoothly for over five years before I switched to an iPhone. I still power it on now and then to go through memos and pictures, and it's still in excellent condition without lag."
"Ahh yes the a21s, i loved that one

The fingerprint scanner was on the back & (even when it looked way off) was one of the best things the phone had, you could unlock it without having to touch the screen with your index finger while holding it, it was damn convenient

Even bought a 2nd, repaired it twice, and am planning to repair it again"
S7 the best
"ive had a S3,S9+,S20+,S22-24 Ultra,and now a S25+. the S9 and 20+ ,and 23 Ultra were the most reliable phones ive ever used. all of their batteries were outstanding. i remember the S23U lasting me all day,6-8hrs SoT,AND  with 25-30% left the next morning. the S24U and S25+ have had the worst battteries , unfortunately."

"Reliable and Samsung dont go together anymore. They have become everything they hated about apple. First they make ads mocking apple about removing headphone jack, removing chargers, removing external storage, and so on. and then they delete the ads and do exactly what apple did. and samsung devices have become really hard to repair. I really wish a new company emerges with great stylus support and so on that will make great reliable phones, not junks like the current samsung phones"

im just a bit of an idiot that sometimes gets way too excited about a newer phone and had money to spare xD"
"the galaxy s5 had thee best software for battery life management, it's when the utra power saving mode was first a thing, then shortly after i got myself a note 4 they ruined the software and it wasn't nearly as good anymore... they've been kinda not special ever since."
"out of a j2 pro, S10, and s21fe? definitely the S10.
j2 pro cost less that 50 AUD and was alright for what it was, S10 was absolutely amazing but the battery has gone to shit, s21fe is an absolute pile of steaming garbage apart from the battery actually being acceptable so I use that instead of the S10 (also 120hz is good when the phone isn't fucking lagging + extra security updates)"

I had a note 10+ 5g for 4 and a half years. It was still running well apart from battery life degrading a bit. I trade it in for an s24 ultra for ¬£150.
"I've been using the Note series since the first Note, which leaves me with my latest Note, the S24 ULTRA. Before I retired, the Notes were part of my working tools. Now that I'm retired, im not sure if my next phone will be top of the line Samsung or something else."
"My S4 lasted 8 years until ot physically and mentally fell apart, it just wouldn't turn on anymore.

My s22 from 4 years ago is still going strong as my office phone.

My s24U is an absolute beast. It has endured so much torment by me and my son, and it still feels like a brand new phone. 

Some phones are just built to last."

Just bought used s23 ultra for $400 and it feels like s25 ultra.
I've the very same model in my handü•π... it's gonna be 5 yrs I'm using it. Can anyone suggest me ...which phone can be a good replacement for this?
"Samsung Rant probably. It was just before smartphones started popping off and it had a physical keyboard. It wasn't my first phone ever but it was my first non-prepaid ""real"" phone.¬† I dropped it so often but it kept chuggin. I found it a couple years ago and it still turned on after a charge.¬†
My S21 is still kickin after 4 years so I think thats a close second. The battery is wearing out a but but that's not a huge deal. Might replace it soon or I might wait til S26 come out.¬†



As for the ones that DO NOT get the award for most reliable... Samsung Intercept was my first smartphone. It was not great. If I dropped it the case and battery came flying off. Also it was really slow to do anything and the plastic in between keys was breaking off.¬†


S3 was fine I don't remember much about it


S5 the charging port broke. Went to get it fixed but replaced it with an s8 instead


S8 started having screen issues. It wasn't cracked but it was similar to the green line issues some have, but not quite the same. (Edit: also both mine and my mom's had a lot of burn in. Mine was mostly where the buttons were, but my mom's screen was pink from burn in)¬† I was due for an upgrade anyways so I got the s21. Haven't had much issue so far."

"I say the galaxy S2, from 2011 and it seems it'll always work! Well, mine started to have a problem where the wireless system instantly causes the whole phone to crash, but it started right after I dropped it so that's my fault not the phone's

Bonus: the award for most UNreliable samsung goes to: galaxy S10! the only phone of mine that had its own f##king board completely die at random"
A50 is my reliable phone . My S22 is ass
"My S20 ultra lasted me 5 years of heavy daily use & many drops. Even then it would have been nearly good as new with a battery replacement.

S8 wasn't great, screen problems. 

S6 fine. No issues."
Hmmm actually the S8 and still have one in play for a watch5
BEST AND BEST FOR ME has been the Galaxy Grand Prime. Stable enough back in the days. But ny Galaxy A21s made me love Samsung istg. It was so worth the price in 2020. It's like a complete budget phone. The Exynos 850 being built on 8nm boosted the 5000mAh battery life like crazy
"s23 ultra. only plan to upgrade after security updates stop, if the battery dies between then and now i will just get a replacement"

"Galaxy J5, no storage space but always worked"
"Note10. Bought new at launch, still have it, still works flawlessly. I've used it a few times when traveling to foreign countries rather than taking my Ultras over the years, and used it for about a week when I was having an issue with my S23u in like Nov of 2023"
"Probably my S22 Ultra, that I've had since March of 2022 and hope to continue having for a pretty good while."
"I'm having in my hand a note10+ since 2020 and running smooth as the first day... 256Gb + 512Gb expanded memory, the only thing i miss is the 3.5mm cord...

Expensive af and trying to be same as Iphone after the explosive s8 mistake"
Pretty much every Samsung phone I've ever used. Currently using the Z Fold 6 and the S25 Ultra.
"Galaxy S3. I haven't used it in years but I'm sure if I press the power button, it'll still boot right back up. And because those things had a tendency to dissipate energy when dropped by sending the back cover and battery flying, saving the internals, they're like roaches and won't die."
"I love my Samsung z flip 4. I just love that I can fold it, and it fits in any pocket, 
But I also like my Samsung s20 fe, that's my spear phone had it a Good couple of years and still work amazing.
Samsung phones are just the best phones."
"I've only had an S22 and currently an S25, and they are as good as any phone I've previously owned. (iPhone 4s, iPhone6, iPhone 6s, iPhone XR, Huawei P30, Samsung S22, Samsung S25) They all have their quirks, but overall every single one has been a good phone, with nothintbut the common gripes for those particular phones."

"Galaxy M52 (or 53) and Galaxy A55 have so far been super reliable. That is surprising since I've frozen / uninstalled quite a bunch of system apps (e.g. Samsung Wallet), and I was expecting it to be unstable at some point. Yet that's not the case."
I really enjoyed my Samsung Galaxy S21 FE but changed it because it didn't have 5G and I needed the extra mobile data power. I'm now on a Google Pixel 9 Pro for a year and only just getting round to liking it slightly. The region and customisation is just not there. I'm switching back to Samsung as soon as I can. Anyone got the latest galaxy? How is it
My samsung s3 or s4 (can't remember) it survived through my life for about 3 years (I got it used) it even survived falling into a puddle. But one day the screen just stopped working in the middleüôÅ. Had to throw it ot because in that day I got a new phone.

"S20 FE - been using it for 5 years with absolutely no hiccups. Even the battery still holds the charge quite well (makes it through the day easy with normal usage). It has had its fair share of falls too (using a TPU back side protector, but no screen protector) and it's still in one piece.

"I did not expect this post to blow up this much lol
Thanks A Lot Everyone!"
"galaxy a5, survived a lot... now has a custom rom on it"
"None.

No joking now - the best was Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo back in the days. But now I am iPhone user for more than 7 years. Honor and Xiaomi were much better experiences for me before. I now have Samsung as a 'in duty' mobile since I cannot use my private phone when in work and man that's a shit XDD"
samsung s25 its beast so powerfull phone
"Samsung cellphones that I've owned: S4, S9, S10+, S21, S22U, and now have upgraded to Fold 7. Loved the S22U with the pen and zooming capabilities. Still have it."
in my personal experience the note 9 was the most reliable and the a53 was the most unreliable
My Galaxy A7(2017) died after 6 years and 2 months. Currently using Galaxy A73(2 years and 5 months). Hopefully it will last for at least 5 years. Muntik mapabili ng S25 Ultra dahil nainggit sa kapatid hahahaha napigilan lang sarili kase hindi ako mayaman at maayos pa din naman phone ko.

Note 9 was incredible! Still think it's one of the most beautiful phones Samsung has ever released
Still using S9+
Still using my daily 2018 Note 9 but preparing the end could be soon :(
"omd i remember my note9 was built like a tank, got ran over 3times and still worked fine"
"It was my first ever contract and I owned it for about two-three years and at the end the fucker was almost falling apart from heavy the beating of my work but never missed a call! Loved the quick button to record calls.

Like you, I switched to Sony, cybershot and Xperia for years until the S4 came out. From then on, S5 LTE Advance from Korea, then Note 5 - 8 - 10+ - S22U currently on use.

The worst to be honest has been this one. The S22U is too laggy and since the last oneui update it got just worse. I'm seriously thinking in use my 10+ again as a main."
"Its Nova Launcher.
My current phone is also a Green A55!"
"Had to scroll all the way to this, my s10 plus is still running well after 6 years of heavy usage"
100%. Mine still works too....
Besides the battery not lasting as long anymore it's been close to perfect for me
"I upgraded from my s10e recently, and passed it on to my daughter. Still works great."
Mine too..
My S10+ Exynos 9820 still running strong after 6 years.
"Ha that's funny, we'll see what you think when it decides to randomly kill its own board...."
the best
Still got mine in mint condition lol but now its just a camera
Best phone ever produced.¬†
"My nephew is still using mine. I can't believe it's still kicking. Launch model, original battery."
It was the ultra before ultra was a thing
"omggg frr ,it was such a beauty to look at compared to newer phones"
The iris scanner worked pretty damn well and was very secure. They should have kept it.
And even got the android 15 update
I got my dad this phone when it was newly released. Every word you said is true. It just refuses to die once it is full even after so many years. But samsung has sortoff forgotten it because some of samsung's own apps like S Health does not run in it. I can't¬† figure out why
My mom is still using the M11 she bought in 2021
6 to 7 hours of SoT after 5 YEARS?? That's pretty damn amazing. Did you use a particular charging pattern?
"Absolutely not. It was my first Android device and it almost made me swear off Samsung until the S9+ won me back over. Touchwiz was a nightmare, bloated, ugly and surprisingly rigid to customize outside of rooting. The plastic body felt cheap, the stupid charging flap was annoying, the front and rear cameras sucked in lowlight, 2GB of RAM was not enough to keep more than 2 apps in memory, updates were late and full of bloatware, the single mono speaker on the back sucked and was awkwardly placed for watching videos, the headphone jack amp was surprisingly underpowered...I can go on. The only saving grace was that beautiful AMOLED screen that got me hooked on Samsung manufactured OLEDs which every smart device I've owned since then use.¬†


Edit: only someone who never actually used the device would dislike my comment. I know what I'm talking about.¬†"
Yes good. Still have one as a spare/ back up
"mine still works for some reason ,like tht thing wont die üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"I had the Note 8 and Note 9. I thought the display on the Note 9 was a *downgrade* from the 8. It just looked clearer and brighter to me. I bought the 9 refurbished, though, so maybe it got dimmer over time."
My favourite one
"As the OP of this post the T-Mobile Note 3 (32 GB) was my first ever phone! IT WAS AND STILL IS AWESOME!!!

https://preview.redd.it/lwbuv01pgnjf1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=475155dd3fc45f273f322002a25e191d61b51cec"
"Note9 display was pretty meh, though. Not nearly bright enough and the HBM blew the colors out and it was still nearly impossible to see in sunlight. I upgraded to my current S24 Ultra and the display is every bit as impressive as the day I bought it. Very easy to see even in direct sunlight."
S2 in 2018 is so crazy lmao
"What you didn't like with iPhone 16 Pro, cause I wanna switch to it from my S24+?"
And now i have S24 üòÇüòÇ
Man samsung quality is good even the budget phone last decently. Currently using s25 because of the chipset and of course durability.
All that needs replacing is a battery and the back cover.
Battery on the base model is meh tough. (Sending this from a base S23)
Get the 23u. Best phone I've ever owned. I haven't used the 25u but I have used the 24u. 23u is better imo. Definitely some great deals on refurbished and decent price on new stock as well
"Love my s23. I replace the battery every 12-18 months for ~$100 for parts and labor. Other than that, it's the perfect size phone for me. Everyone always comments that my videos and pictures look amazing. No need to upgrade to a newer/bigger phone I say."
"It surely is - by far the best phone I've ever had.

But yes, just like others said, the S24 and the S25 are definitely better choices as they will receive way more Android versions than the S23, which I think will get Android 17 as its last major update.

But if you're on a budget and the S23 is the best you can get, go for it, you won't regret it!"
You should because no point emptying wallet for new S series s23 is as good as them or maybe s24 if you want a free S pen it‚Äôs also a good choice
"I would advise you to go for s24. s23 has only 2 more years of software updates and 3 for security updates, while s24 has 6 more years for both updates."
"S23 is disgustingly reliable. My girlfriend has one, and it's almost shocking how much this little device can withstand."
23 is really great and 25 plus is awesome also.
Just get a S20. There's absolutwly no difference.
"Xiaomi 4x
Samsung a53
Samsung s23u"
Don't unless you want a totally degraded camera. It is abysmal. I regret buying the S23
Just got the S23+. Highly recommend it.
"The s (alone) battery sucks... i had a s22, and the battery never lasted the day."
I got an s23 and love it <3
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know. :)
Man I dropped mine like 3 months after getting it and it killed the screen. And I got it only because I dropped my Note10+ in the fucking harbor before going on a boat ride. Man I‚Äôd still be using my Note10+ if I could. Fuckkkkkk
"S10 plus is cool i had it until 2025 summer, it has really good cameras i thought the s24u will be a massive upgrade, yeah it was a massive upgrade in camera optimization, low light, different scenario, video, zoom, etc. But if you just make a same photo in good light with both phones on 1x they give almost the same detalization yeah the color correction on s24u is better but details are same and if you take the 3x telephoto and use only it in pro mode to zoom up to 10x and use the 2x telephoto on s10 plus the results are almost the same so if you take the s23u that uses that 3x sensor up to 10x zoom or the base s24 than that range of zoom will also be almost same"
"True,I had a s10+ as well,and it was a masterpiece aswell"
"Soon trueeee bro,they don't make phones like that anymore üò≠"
"https://preview.redd.it/sp9uxbso98jf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e186c5686da3d99ed98c1795e4b2f5d815f89b4

My samsung health and Samsung health monitor works perfectly fine.

What's wrong with yours?

BTW my M21 is paired with GW5."
Samsung M series phones are built to last.
"No nothing actually crazy, I used to drain phone upto 10% then charge upto 100%, I avoided overnight charging.

The main reason why is still get 7 hrs or even 8 hrs of SOT is the starting capacity of 6000mAh, it's actually massive and then now its degraded to 70-72% BH about 4000mAh still left.

If I replace my battery rn I will get 10-11 hrs of SOT, no jokes.(like I'm 2020 how I used to get, maybe 10 ish hours because of hungry apps nowadays)"
I instantly had custom rom on it lol sad that you were stuck with touchwiz
That charging flap also broke off quite easily. It was rather pointless.
"Going from Samsung to Apple and not having the same features, like pointing my camera at something and Ai giving me the low down etc. The iPhone itself felt good in my hand though, and there were no scrolling issues (stuttering) like there are on Pixel so it just felt nice to use. The S24+ was just a solid phone, and when the 26 comes out, I'm dumping this Pixel for one immediately."
My base s23 arrives on Monday. What sot do you get?
One ui 8 update gonna bring some battery improvements
"I might be biased as an S23 user because I upgraded from an s10e (which had a small 3000 mah battery), but the battery life has been amazing for me in the last 2 years of ownership, so much so that I keep it charged to 80% and I still go a full day on moderate use with a single charge"
Ive never used s23u for longer than 5 minutes but i own a s24u in my country s24u used in perfect shape is 100$ more than s23u in pretty much same condition and the screen on s24u is way better imo the anti reflective coating combined with 2600 nits peek is soo nice outside.
Ive had the S23U    I upgraded to the s25U because the s23U started overheating too much         the s25U is better in ever single possible way besides you could argue the spen   and maybe past 30x camera was a little clearer but after the first S25U update its basically equal
Small phones are cool but i love my s24u
"Yeah, 24 and 25 are a no-go for me. I don't care too much about android updates as long as the phone still works fine."
"I have the s24 after the lease is up I'm keeping it and getting s25 or maybe iPhone (I low key miss the FaceTimes) but I am currently on my iPhone 12 and the battery is an issue. I might do (this might be dumb) this year finish with s24 then get iPhone, then pay that off two years later get another Samsung and keep that pattern... I mean I did have the iPhone from 2021 until last year..."
Except for the horribly disappointing camera
S20 is out of software update and has out of date camera better getting s23
Doesn‚Äôt look it to me
You're Welcome!
"Two solid phones, in my opinion the s10 series were one of the best ever Samsung phones made"
"I originally got a custom ROM when it was on Kit Kat. I dropped it and had to get it replaced and unfortunately, the King Root method was patched on Lolipop.¬†"
It was such a bad design. I'm glad Samsung and the rest of the industry figured out waterproofing without the flap.¬†
"https://preview.redd.it/v6tg5ae059jf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=606bf06f6ea2955b59336df2ebc23b0473b7900a

No power saving mode and stuff, all wifi though cause I am sick"
"What's wild is before I moved to Android, my last iPhone was an iPhone 6s Plus. I remember thinking it was an enormous phone. It's the exact same size as my s23. I hope they never make the base model much bigger, anything larger than this is ridiculous feeling in my hands lol. Even with the base model, I have to use the one-handed shortcut sometimes. My hands aren't even that small!"
"its fine if you don't care about the new features new android brings, but 23 only gets 3 more years of security updates, while 24 and 25 get 6 and 7 more years respectively, which alone should be enough to go for 24 or 25."
"They made the pro iphone bigger and may make the base bigger aswell everyone will follow them( honestly 6,1 inch is perfect but they made pro 6,3"
"Wow, congrats üëè
Buy an insurance from Samsung.¬†"
"Bro you just won almost 2000$, wild üòÖüëç"
Marvel at its beauty. Might want to grab a case too.
"Yeah get insurance, then if you care a case too."
"Hi

Just use it üòäüëç

After 2 months you would be used to these like when you bought a games console or a PC.

(the feeling of novelty fades in 2 months)

Enjoy your new galaxy."
"Send it my way... üòÜ 

Congrats!!!"
"Congrats, I participated as well, the guy (norperte) who beat me answered all questions in 9 seconds. What was your time?"
![gif](giphy|3SYzsmD8yQOoyeO4YY)
Congratulations bro üéâüëè
"Well, I can't say anything more than congrats and take extra care for your phone"
"Awesome! Make sure to get a case as the others said! I've seen people get this one https://amzn.to/4mObF2J and then if you want a more expensive premium version, I recommend this one https://amzn.to/46UxKrN"
What did you do to win? Just participate or answered questions right
Congrats G. Enjoy your new phone
Congrats G. Enjoy your new phone
"Save it from dust. i've seen a few flips which couldn't open or close all the way. also keep the screen safe. that is all. other than that, gg"
"Screen protector on the front screen (mandatory for me if you want to use the Flex Mode), and a good case if you want to be extra careful (don't buy a Samsung one, they don't cover the hinge and external display)"
Congratulations üéâ
Congrats. That is incredible!!
you one lucky fucker. congrats! lol
Congrats! Enjoy it!
Watch out for return shipping scammers just keep the phone
You're the right person to receive this! Hope you have a lot of fun with it
Congrats! Huge W and welcome to the Fold fam ü•≥
As opposed to the OLD Samsung Z Fold 7?
"Sell and buy an ultra, more durable and last longer"
Sell it asap
I would just sell it instead of worring if i will break my expensive phone.
Good idea I probably will! Thanks!
"It's worth 3000 here in Australia üòÖ, I'm definitely very happy right now"
"Definitely going to grab, especially after seeing jerry rig everything's video üòÖ"
Definitely going to get both probably
Thanks man!
Thanks so much lol :)
"Like 23 seconds lol, he probably cheated"
Thanks dude!
"I definitely will, especially considering how easy it is to scratch the inner screens"
"Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely check these out! Thanks!"
I had to answer 5 questions as well and fast as I can
Thanks :)
"Yeah that's fair, thanks for the tip!"
"That's fair, I'll definitely buy a screen protector for the outer screen, and I'm already looking on Amazon for cases (not Samsung ones)"
Thank you :)
"Haha, thanks!"
Thanks man!
I gotchu
Thanks so much man! :)
Thank you :)
"Hell nah, I'm keeping it"
"I'm not gonna be worrying, I'm just going to be careful with it."
I would sell it if you dont like it and get an s25 or 24 so it's more durable
Not the JerryRig trauma üò≠üòÇ
"Yeah i smell foul play, cause there was no restrictions on sharing answers. Like I can do it again on my sister's account and again on my mum's account and same answers lol"
:)
I would do this without even opening the box
"Yeah, they probably did do something like that"
"What a surprise...since no other ""rival"" sells the 8 elite in so many different phones at the same time globally."
">Near the beginning of the year, market analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that Samsung may have set a shipment target of 40 million units for the Galaxy S25 series. According to new information, Samsung exceeded 20 million Galaxy S25 sales by the end of June and outsold every other Snapdragon 8 Elite phone combined.

>So far, Samsung's flagship series has been a global success, but to put things into perspective, we can compare global Snapdragon 8 Elite sales. Leaker @UniverseIce shared some fun facts that shed some light on Samsung's performance compared to its Android rivals.

>The Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra exclusively use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip globally. More specifically, these Samsung premium phones are equipped with a special edition ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.

>What's interesting is that, thanks to the Galaxy S25 series, Qualcomm sold more than 20 million Snapdragon 8 Elite ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù chips, making this version more popular than the standard one.

>Reportedly, the combined sales of the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which other Android OEMs used for their premium phones, were lower than 20 million.

>In other words, not only does this show that Samsung's exclusive Elite version is by far the most popular in the world, but it also means that the Galaxy S25 series alone outsold all of its other Android competitors combined ‚Äî at least those who used the standard version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in their phones.

>Samsung is Qualcomm's most profitable smartphone partner, judging by sales. Ironically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, which Qualcomm and Samsung co-developed, is more popular than the base version developed solely by Qualcomm.

>The chip version exclusive to Samsung has the main CPU cores clocked at a higher frequency of 4.47GHz, up from the standard version's 4.32GHz.

>The source also mentions that the same story will likely repeat next year with the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. The upcoming Galaxy S26 might get a ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù version that will probably outsell its standard counterpart."
"Well yeah, Samsung is the most prolific Android OEM on the planet.

For huge sums of the phone buying market it is either iPhone or Samsung. Everything else is single digit market share percentages.

It would be surprising if they weren't the leader in sales of one of the best SOCs on the market."
Not that surprised really. Tho I wonder how the hell did s25 ultra outsell s24 ultra without a single revolution bruh
"Makes sense, especially since Chinese OEMs like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi released many flagship phones with Medatek chips, and mainly just Ultra phones got the Snapdragon 8 Elite. In contrast Samsung did the opposite equiping the whole lineup with 8 Elite, and the usual Snapdragon-Exynos mixup"
"It is unsurprising that Samsung maintains a prominent position within the Android ecosystem. The implementation of the 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy in the S25 series further solidifies this, particularly when contrasted with the S24 series' regional variations in processor usage."
No surprises. Best of all. Number one. No rivals.
"Still a bit mad, S24 had Exyshit, and seeing Samsung's pattern here, S26 will most likely have it as well, which is a no brainer skip from me."
Only brand that makes me think about leaving Samsung is Google and even then its very minor
The most popular device sells the most‚Ä¶ my god how far topics of discussion have fallen. Next up: water makes things wet.
And am yet these fuckers refuse to give a Snapdragon tablets. I have been clinging on to my S8+ and Everytime I think of upgrading I remember that there are no Snapdragon versions anymore. Sigh
"On Thursday I received a Xiaomi 15, having an S21 + with Exynos, when I went to configure some options as I have in the S21 + such as the do not disturb mode, where in Samsung you can even configure APP that skip that mode, or the dual SIM management, something incomprehensible how badly it is managed in Xiaomi, if you use the management with dual APP to have personal and work WhatsApp, all the contacts get mixed up, in both WhatsApp apps you have all the contacts mixed up, and if you use parallel space, the contacts you have within that parallel space, if they call you their name does not appear in the call ... In addition to many other things that surprise me that at this point HyperOS does not have, what I mean, it is normal that Samsung sells more, in the end you realize that yes, they are more expensive, but the operating system also counts when you buy a phone, and in that OneUI is far above the rest of the manufacturers that use Android.

Now I'll wait for the S26+ which hopefully comes with Qualcomm"
Also helps that Samsung S series is the go to work phone supplied to most companies.
"This is not a surprise. Love itnor hate it, Samsung is the face of Android. The 8 elite for the s25 series also helped that unlike the s24 series last year which on other regions used Exynos for the base model and the plus."
"Ok, how many returns though."
This phone was the most disappointing Samsung release in recent memory
Lots of weirdness with the elite though. The flip is exynos globally. The Razr only has the elite if you purchase the ultra. Lots of phones that I would normally expect to have it just... Don't. Not that they would have been real competition for the s25 either way
no wonder why googles new feature comes on Galaxy before Pixels
Sd 8 elite is an absolute beast.
"Most people don't upgrade every year. If you had the 22 ultra before and are looking to upgrade, most people are probably thinking ""might as well go for the 25 than the 24""?"
"It could be people switching over from Apple. I upgraded my iPhone 11 Pro to the S25 Ultra this year and absolutely love it. Obviously never had the S24, so going to this one from the iPhone felt like a massive upgrade"
I guess it's just because it doesn't dig into your hand as much
[deleted]
"Exynos regions got to taste a hard cucumber again with the s24 series, same as the s22 series. Many sold their s22s for the 23s. The same might play a role between s24 and s25."
It's because my s23 suddenly get that green line after 2 years
That was definitely generated with ChatGPT
clearly didn't disappoint Samsung's financial department
I mean Lowkey true but s24 was pretty perfect for my except the chip. Now my phone feels nearly perfect. The battery could have been larger but eh
"That's because it's expensive as fuck, I think it's like a third of the total cost of an s25 ultra to make."
"This was me. I was rocking my S21 Ultra, for whom I didn't have much reason to upgrade, except the lack of memory and better camera. And, given how satisfied with the S25 Ultra I currently am, it will probably be a couple of years again until I upgrade :)"
"This was me when my S22 Ultra got bricked on Christmas Eve 2024. I could have gotten the S24 Ultra but thought ""the S25 Ultra is just around the corner might as well get the latest Samsung with pre-order discounts"".

I did have to daily a Samsung A35 while waiting but no biggie."
"Can confirm, got lured with iPhone esque esthetics"
I do see a lot of former IPhone users posting their S25 Ultra upgrade on this app on elsewhere. It could be one of the reasons.
Lowkey o thought s24 ultra looked more premium and interesting but yeah that makes sense
it still leaves mark on palm when holding it on one hand tho and has larger mark than s24 ultra but less pain than s24 ultra did regardless of case on or not
I meant the ultra only. The base model is understandable
"Nope, thats wrong. The S23 had all snapdragon as well and the S24 outsold it by quite a lot.

Nobody outside of terminally online redditor weirdos much cares about the exynos/snapdragon ""controversy""."
"While that's fair, I still find it reasonable. In my country, I see S25 selling at about ~650‚Ç¨ with taxes included when sales take place, which I think is a very decent price for the phone."
Same! :) Galaxy S29 Ultra here we come!
Should I wait for the s26 ultra or buy the s25 ultra during the BF?
"Yeah samsung phpnes always drop in value fast, but the price quqlcomm set for the 8 elite is nuts."
"Well, I'd wait for the S26 Ultra and see if they will bring back air actions for the S Pen. It was one of the biggest, and few, disappointments I have with the phone, for every now and then instance I needed it. Worst case scenario, they don't, then you can always find an S25 Ultra at a discounted price."
"I've heard that they're going to abolish it, which is a bit of a leap. 
I don't mind if it's there or not."
"Well then, I guess if you're not in a hurry, and want to see what the 26 will bring, i don't think that you will make a grave regret, regardless if you buy the new one, or a discounted 25. I've been rocking mine ever since february, and I am pretty satisfied with it.. So, I guess, regardless of if you wait or don't, you won't be making a mistake :)"
Group. Including electronics
"nope this sub is about Toshiba laptops, and mercury thermometers."
"Ok I was wondering cause I don‚Äôt see any post about Samsung C&T, Life insurance, SDS or Heavy Industries on here ."
Really!? I have been thinking about getting a Toshiba laptop and a Mercury thermometer
"+1 Idk why people downvoting you?

Maybe people with broken humor on reddit."
What‚Äôs the point of this comment ?
Less demand. Most people know Samsung for their mobile and electronics divisions.
What‚Äôs the point of yours? Go complain elsewhere.
"I don‚Äôt know about, but I guess it depends peoples circles; I have seen many people talking about the construction business and the heavy industries way more than their electronics but that could be due to the class of people I‚Äôm around."
I asked a simple question. Your comment adds to what I asked nor does it answer the question.
True. But you're still welcome to post anything regarding Samsung here.
"Curious.

You‚Äôre able to understand context from replies yet you‚Äôre unable to figure out if this sub is the one you‚Äôre looking for."
"How about you go harass someone else ? 

The sub is named Samsung and not Samsung Electronics so I asked does it cover everything in Samsung because all the post are about phones which is a legitimate question."
For ridiculous prices
"Change the aspect ratio in the camera app when shooting either and the rule of 3s grid will adjust to that aspect and display in that aspect. 
Tap the 4 dot to the right of the camera app, near the bottom, and a menu pops to the left and has the aspects."
"changing aspect ratio has been a thing on galaxy devices since the S6, you must be pretty young if you‚Äôre asking these easy questions."
I'm pretty sure OP wants to shoot in 3:4 but still have the overlay grid for 9:16.

You must be younger than me if your attention span doesn't allow you to read past the title.
That would be wonky. I wish the native camera app allowed you to just set your own grid lines - number and position.
Exactly.

"As others have pointed out what you‚Äôre looking for already exists within Samsungs camera settings and has for years, you don‚Äôt need a separate overlay. No amount of projecting will change that."
"It's not bad at all, some camera apps offer this purely for social media."

"""Brand Identity""...Apple and Google has basically taken the 2 other options in terms of camera alignment. The 3rd would be circular but that's been taken by the Chinese manufacturers."
Which is why I still feel the Galaxy S10 series was peak. Camera on the back was perfect. Should have never left it
Care more about camera transitioning than a little wobble when it sits on a desk.
Really surprised¬†that Samsung leadership hasn‚Äôt yet done its absolute favorite hobby..staring at Pixel‚Äôs camera layout like it‚Äôs a group project and then ‚Äúsubmitting‚Äù their own version two weeks later.
Still using and loving my Fold5.  I'll keep this phone at least two maybe three more years.
"Regarding brand identity, Apple and Google have established dominance in camera alignment options. The circular design, while a viable alternative, has been widely adopted by Chinese manufacturers."
How is the porn experience on the fold ? #Askingforafriend
"The real problem is there's a hole in the screen, Samsung themselves solved it with the A80 and many Chinese manufacturers in like 2018 or something. It may be forgivable on the outside, but even the inside display has it 

What year is it."
"Put some bluetack on it - problem solved!

or get a case"
"I don't really blame them because it is a great design, but they need to figure out a way to make it less wobbly.

The surface duo 2's camera bump was slanted so that the other side could rest ""flat"" on it I wonder if it's possible to do something similar here."
"Problem was that switching between lenses was quite obvious because of the way they were located. Maybe they can get around it with software now, but it wasn't great 6 years ago."
A ‚Äúlittle‚Äù wobble? It‚Äôs a ridiculous wobble
Huh?
lol
I did find it interesting that the fold 6 had the inside screen go over the camera hole but they went back to an actual hole on the 7.  Wondering if maybe they found the image quality was suffering.
Case doesn't fix it.
"Yeah...I completely agree that the wobble is crazy...even with a case. Even Apple was ""smart"" enough to notice this as their phones get thinner hence why they're going with the visor look on the next iPhone. I don't really know what Samsung can do to mitigate it without making the phone look like an ugly piece of crap with vertical cameras."
"You would think it would be as much of a gap as vertical, just going from a height issue versus horizontal?"
Ya the 7 Fold is worst we've seen. I'm just saying I never just let my phone lay on a table and use it like that. I actually pick it up.
I heard its because they dont own the tech and since then they got into some legal shit with the company that does and they couldn't put it in the 7.
"Yeah, that's what I thought, but Samsung seems to have fixed this problem, whereas [Google ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/s/B6nizuvEpP) is still struggling with it. Maybe it's due to something else, I don't know."
"Ever eaten lunch or breakfast while going through emails or texts? I do that on a daily basis as I get ready for the day and when I'm eating lunch if I have to catch up on something.

I have to open the Fold 7 if I want to do that because the wobble makes it unusable."
That's interesting. And definitely makes sense.
"Ya. I finish my bite, put the food down, continue chewing my food while I pick up my phone. Set it back down and continue eating lol. I can do everything fast with two hands and phone in hand than tapping from above."
Not available in the UK yet unfortunately
"I got update notification also. Installed on my galaxy watch ultra, and I verry much hate how they redesigned tiles and notifications. They look ugly compared to pre update..."
Beta? Aren't they supposed to be releasing the finished version right now?
"Still using 6.1 but on my lowly A15 5G, lol."
Can you share some screenshots?
How's now bar working with sports from Google on one ui 8? Currently running one ui 7 and the ONLY now bar sports from Google that works for me is MLB. Three weeks of NFL preseason and not once have i seen an NFL game show up. (Yes I follow NFL I follow certain teams and I have tried cleaning the personalized search clearing data etc.)
Settings. Now bar. Sports from Google. Then you have e to Google and follow teams and sports.
S23 first beta in September?
Jacksonville Jaguars new Orleans saints are on currently
GalaxyS24 user on Tmobile here in Chicago Il & still no Aug2025 security update & no OneUI8 Beta üò¢
I'm wondering if One UI 8 on the Galaxy S24 Series has the Now Brief feature.
Installed it didn't notice a big difference at all other than signing up for some AI stuff
Can I update if I have s 24 fe?
I didn't even got one ui 7 update and 8 has been released
Z Fold 6?
How... ? We got oneui7 a couple of months ago and oneui 6 like 1 year ago lol
"Not sure when UK release is. I was not aware they started rolling out August 11 and I just happened to check for available beta programs in the members app. Hopefully you guys get it soon. So far, it is good. Just had to re-enable some Good Lock stuff. Home Up currently not available, but everything else is. Upgrade was seamless. Battery life seems improved and display seems a little ""crisper"". They still have the pill style battery indicator though."
"I saw an article saying it was live in the UK and India, but India has technical issues. I have been waiting to join, do we know when it goes live in the UK?"
This is not for the watch this is for the phone.
"I have GW6C, so will likely be a while before I get One UI 8 for that. Was surprised by the S24 beta, because I haven't been keeping up with release date for Samaung as I prep to switch to OnePlus."
"Apparently not. From what I understand, they just started rolling beta for S24 on August 11. I just happened to check the Members App for fun and saw I could join a beta for my S24 Ultra. I check every few days just to see if any of my devices qualify for a beta. This is the first time I have actually gotten into a beta for Samsung. 

So far, so good. No big changes apparent. Most everything carried over seamlessly from One UI 7. Only thing that has bugged me is that Home Up is not currently available for me to adjust how my recent apps page looks and operates. I don't like the side scroll rotating column style. I prefer them laid out as tiles I can easily flick away."
My spare A15 5G I have as a backup phone got One Ui 7 last month I believe. USA!
"What would like shots of? So far, not a lot of difference between One UI 7 and 8. They finally updated Home Up, so I could my recent apps screen back from rotsting tiles to flat tiles."
I am not sure as I do not really get into sports ball. I can install it and see real quick.
"I set it up to follow MLB and NFL. As soon as I see some love notifications on now bar, I will let you know what I find out."
Yep. Got it done. Just waiting for something to come through. I subbed to NFL and MLB.
I have no idea what rhe release schedule is. This caught me by surprise.
S23 won't get a beta. OneUI 8 for s23 will be the public rollout sometime they said in September.
Ok. Let me try to add those and see. Any other teams later today or tonight?
"When I got the beta ir said for unlocked devices only, so I think you might have to wait until they have a beta for your carrier or until the release for One UI 8 for S24 series."
"It doesn't seem to have the widget for it, so not sure as of now."
Does it bring the Now Brief ?
"If it is an unlocked S24 (meaning you bought from Samaung without a specific carrier attached), then I believe so. I have S24 Ultra, so not sure if that makes a difference. Go to the Samsung Members App, scroll to the bottom where the beta section is and see if you have option to join the beta for it."
"Still waiting, I've been checking a few times a day. United States here."
Not that I am aware of yet.
"One UI 7 was delayed so long that it ran over the release time, so they are pushing out One UI 8 actually more on the time it should have released, but even that is a bit behind this year. One UI 8 for watches is coming to older modes soon too, because they are skipping One UI 7 for watches."
I have it already in the UK
"I know, i just warning, that watch one is shit asf

You will need to sideload the latest HomeUp APK. It restored my HomeUp functionality on my Fold 6 Oneui 8.0 beta
So nothing new about the UI?
Assuming this did not work? Disappointed in the now bar functionality.
Chicago bears and buffalo bills play at 8pm eastern time
Thank you!
I can check for you - where would it be?
"Thanks for the tip. Will give it a shot. Home Up shows but when I tap it, it says it isn't available yet. I will grab the apk and try to sideload. I hate the rotating tiles for recent apps."
They wound up releasing an update before I had to sideload. Working again.
"Nothing that seems really significant so far. I need to check out a change log and see what is different or added, but so far nothing really sticks out."
I haven't yet seen any notifications or now bar for sports. Are there any games on today? Any specific teams I could add to follow?
"So, still nothing on any notifications or scores. I triple checked settings and all seems good there. I will let you know if anything changes, but so far looks like it is a lingering bug."
"Ok. I added Jacksonville and Saints. Nothing showing still. I will add Bears and Buffalos too. Though, I would think just following NFL should give me anything currently going."
"Welcome. Tbh, you aren't really missing anything. I haven't noticed anything really significant from One UI 7, and have a few bugs I have stumbled across. Most annoyingly is when I have Facebook open, switch to another app, and then back, it takes me FB messenger and I lose my place where I was on Facebook. 2 other apps also take me to a sub-portion of the app instead of back to the main app I had open. Kind of annoying."
Should show somewhere in the settings
"Thanks a lot!

Uff I was hoping for a new ui (or revisited)"
Now bar is installed but Now Brief is not visible if its on the phone in this initial firmware
"I will poke a around some more and see. I am sure there are differences, but most of my settings and stuff carried over or re-iterated themselves once I updated apps like Good Lock. Therefore, I did not have to explore a whole lot to make things work, and the little I did was identical to One UI 7. I was really hoping they would ditch the pill design battery indicator, but it seems Samsung is as committed to the pill design as they are the squircle on the watches. Most people don't like it, but Samsung gives zero craps about what the customers like or want."
does it actually dry your clothes fully. I‚Äôm a little nervous with it being a 2 in 1 that it will leave the clothes kind of moist
"Seriously, in a community of 434k users, this is the only new post we have in 3 days? 

Can the censorship be any more blatant?"
"""With this AI engine, Micro RGB Color Booster Pro recognizes scenes with dull color tones and intelligently enhances colors across all content for a more vivid and immersive viewing experience.""

So much about making shit ""more vivid."" I don't want more vivid. Color accuracy, contrast, brightness, and refresh rate.

We need 600hz. All major framerate media can be multiplied to 600 which is why plasma kicked so much ass in that department.

TVs are so bright and accurate now that anything more is going to be an incremental improvement at best."
So...OLED-ish?
"It would just be nice to see regular scenes when they are a bit dark, instead of just shadows moving around. Maybe fix the audio, so its more leveled and consistent."
"So this is MicroLED but with a rename for sammy products?!, great I guess."
"The Micro RGB Color Booster Pro's AI engine identifies scenes with muted color palettes, subsequently applying intelligent color enhancements to all content, thereby generating a more vibrant and engaging visual experience.

The focus should be on color accuracy, contrast, brightness, and refresh rate.

A 600Hz refresh rate is desired, as it accommodates the multiplication of all major framerate media, a key advantage of plasma technology.

Current television technology has achieved high levels of brightness and accuracy, suggesting that further enhancements will likely yield only marginal improvements."
"any idea if this will be coming to tablets, laptops and phones?"
"Thanks, 1080p is fine for me tho"

It's not really censorship. Queue is just backed up. Contrary to popular belief, we (the mods) do touch grass and try to enjoy summer. Also, most post in queue break tech support or ""what should I buy?"" rules."

No
Wow you're so cool.
"For over a month now, all new posts in this subreddit require moderator approval. That means real-time discussion has been essentially frozen, and critical feedback is bottlenecked. 

Whether intentional or not, the effect is to shield the brand from public scrutiny. In a community of 434k people, this is not how an open forum should operate."
Every post requires mod approval? This is the most Reddit thing I've read all day.
This is so fucking stupid lmao
">Whether intentional or not, the effect is to shield the brand from public scrutiny.

Look at /r/android and their post content philosophy.

>Content which benefits the community (news, rumours, and discussions) is generally allowed and is valued over content which benefits only the individual (technical questions, help buying/selling, rants, self-promotion, etc.) which will be removed if it's in violation of the rules.

This is what all big subreddits should have. Every individual (and some cultures tend to be louder individually) complaining does nothing for the community. You can call it public scrutiny, I call it spam and waste of everybody's time reading the [same post over and over again](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/88rc3v/the_predictable_threads_are_driving_me_insane).

>In a community of 434k people, this is not how an open forum should operate.

This is not an open forum. This is a community forum. The community decides. Guess what /r/android decided on.

It's funny, because phone is just one product out of so many different products that the company makes."
"Also, it's worth noting that you're entire post history on r/Samsung is filled with tech support post (breaking rule 4) or comments upset that you can't. I have responded to you're comments almost every time (as I do when anyone brings feedback) and yet you continue. This was a post about the new TV launch. Keep the discourse on track."
"You can criticize Samsung all you want. Heck, even I do. As long as you dont break the rules and foster discussion, anything and I mean ANYTHING related to Samsung is allowed. Just last week several post got approved discussing the meltdown Samsung TV servers had. It is easier to moderate the sub than rely on automod."
"Not ""every post"" just post that would have been removed by automod. Instead of being removed, they go to manual approval now. You can see the +1 icon, the second reason is automod. The other post went to manual approval because it was under 100 letters or something like that."
"This kills a sub long term.

You need to allow people to have actual discussions and tech questions. What's the point of not allowing this? If you don't want to moderate, then don't. But don't kill a good sub out of laziness. 

  
This sub looks already pretty dead when it's filled with posts that are many days old."
"It is important to note that techl support not permitted here, as there are other dedicated subreddits for Android, technical support, and Samsung support. This has always been the established rule. The manual queue is one of the methods the mod team employs to effectively manage this subreddit, and the team has been pleased with its performance. It allows us to personally review posts instead of relying solely on automod, although we still utilize auto mod as well.

It is challenging to conclude that the subreddit is being negatively impacted by manual approval, especially considering that comments, views, visits, and member count have all increased. While the number of posts has decreased, so have the number of removals and reports. We are currently experimenting with manual approval, and the moderation team has observed that users seem less frustrated with manual removals compared to automated ones. It is also worth mentioning that members generally seem to have more respect for manual approvals than for automated ones. For example, we encountered a situation where a user was attempting to solicit referral links (which are prohibited for obvious reasons) and believed their post was being removed due to the inclusion of the words ""Watch 6 Classic."" They repeatedly submitted the same post, trying different variations such as ""watch 6 cl@ssic,"" which filled the queue and caused frustration for the poster. In contrast, with manual removal, we can directly inform the user about the specific rules they have violated."
One of my posts got removed manually yet I received no feedback.

I am not sure why you didn't get a reason, but my best guess would be that it was removed under rule 4 or buying/selling. As you see, I wasnt the one who removed it. Maybe you should use mod mail instead of blowing up my DMs."
"> Maybe you should use mod mail instead of blowing up my DMs

After you just admitted how backed up your modmail is, and how all your mods are ""touching grass"" and therefore not actively moderating, why would anyone modmail you? Lmfao"
"Sending a single message after weeks of no response is not ""blowing up your DMs"" but go off I guess"
"Mod mail was/is not backed up. The queue was just backloged for a few hours. Modmail allows all mods to see the messages, so the mod who removed the post and respond."
Dude you've got to follow basic reddiquette. Imagine if every one DMed myself or any of the mods for every issue on the sub? We already get tons of DMs from people thinking we work for Samsung. How difficult is it to use mod mail?
"""System"" is the files that make up Android. You can't do anything about those.

""Other"" usually consists of extra app data (like if you download songs in Spotify) or items in your Downloads folder that don't fit in the other categories (like Excel spreadsheets)."
Nah nah nah the important question is how the fuck are you running your device on 32 fucking gigs??
System is the operating system (android). You can't really do anything about it. Get an SD card if possible.
32gb in 2025 is crazy
"""Other"" are mostly saves from edited images and videos. To revert back to the original, the system makes a copy of the file."
"System is OS related. Others consist of files not recognised by the Android System but they are there as part of other apps or stuff that can be opened with specialised software/apps. 

Suppose, you have a lot of digital books (eBooks/comics), they aren't supported by base Android. They can be opened using Apps specifically meant to open them like a Comic Book Reader or eBook reader. These will count as ""Others"".

Similar, most games nowadays need to download additional resources like shaders, etc. These are typically not supported by the system and each app (games here) use/load these. These often are stored in /Android/data or /Android/obb so they count as part of the app size but if some app were to store data on the internal storage then those would count as Others. For example, the built-in logs are stored in the internal directory often under a directory of the same name.

Basically, besides any standard types like Image/Photo, Video, Music, Application, etc. count as ""Others""."
"System is basically files that help the phone and updates and blah, others is like things that don't really help run the phone but they also can't be removed."
"The system is your device's Android.

Others consist of many different things, from shadow files of pictures and videos you edit (which allows the system to revert back to the old version), and all the files that are not in those categories available."
"if you use spotify, you can go to the built in spotify settings and clear cache. It caches most of the songs you listen to and for me personally ends up being a few gigs every few weeks or days i check."
32gb storage in 2025 is wild
im more concerned about the 32gb... how???? in 2025 bro???
"since i cant post here my self, where can i post if i have a problem with my phone?

My problem: My S21 FE has a touchscreen error, and now that it has been restarted, I can no longer enter my password.

To be precise, only the ‚Äú1‚Äù doesn't work.

Since the device requires the password once when booting up, this is really difficult.

An external keyboard doesn't work.

Rotating the keyboard doesn't work.

Making the keyboard smaller doesn't work.

Entering the number 1 at ""emergency call"" works, but cannot be copied.

any other ideas?  
i really dont want to buy a new display."
Other is secret folder i think
android bloat basically
"What sucks about ""System"" sometimes there is ""dead data"" in it. Updates dont always delete old useless files sadly."
/system is modifiable but does need root or an unlocked bl
I thought other was the root and boot partitions (and others like kernel)
spotify is flagged as system apps
Spotify songs would be flagged as music though. 'Other' is more of a catchall for files that dont fit into any category above.
"Only an A26 and lower has that. But given that this is a 32Gb phone, it probably has one."
"You cant put apps on an SD card anymore.  Devices that have SD card, can not run apps from the SD card."

"If you just want to delete useless files from System, just restore the system using Odin"
"No. But Netflix, Facebook, and OneDrive sure do. At least, on all Samsung phones in my region. They can't be uninstalled and can only be disabled. Maybe it can be done using ADB but that's a whole other thing."
Or just app data.
"It wouldn‚Äôt, your phone doesn‚Äôt know what Spotify is using that storage for and it would be categorized as ‚ÄúApps‚Äù"
"What the...
Really? Well then OP has a nice brick soon."
Yes they can
"Not true you can definitely  put apps on SD card and still run them off a SD card, I do so on my s9 fe , s10 fe and s10+ tabs aswell as used to on my A03 way back when, you just have to use an app like apps to SD to move the apps that are movable to your SD card and once moved most apps can be run from your SD card."

 It does by the file type.
"No, they can't"
"just checked, i can. in dev settings there's  ""force allow apps on external "" and then a ""change"" button in storage options in app info appears, changing the storage used.

It works on some models that support sd card. It does work on my A31 but doesn't on my S20U for some reason.
"It doesn't work. Feel free to try, it will move nothing or next to nothing to the sd. Tried on my tab S9 multiple times with large apps and made no difference (also it got stuck frequently)."
"Shitty that it requires the extra steps, but that was an epic shutdown if I've ever seen one lol¬†"
"i tried it and it works. 

consider the fact that app data is usually stored somewhere else, the app itself is the one that gets moved. the location of where the apk sit is is in /mnt/asec, (in linux ""/"" being the c:\\ in windows. so it's basically c:\\mnt\\asec), which you can't access with the normal file manager, the only file manager i found that opens those system folders is zarchiver, file manager+,cx file explorer, any app with a terminal, and possibly others too; other way to access that folder is with adb using adb shell comand, or with android studio. that's a read only folder, which means that it's safe to snoop around since you need root to edit it. everything outside /storage/emulated/0 can't be edited without root. idk if it is possible to move the folder with the app's data or ,if it is possible, if it can be done without root"
"they probably did that because it might not be very reliable and with budget phones hardly ever being 64gb nowadays, they probably also thought that it wasn't that necessary"
"Good for you that it works on your device. On mine it didn't, was bugged (the sd itself is fine and currently in use on other device) or the impact was minimal. I would say it's not very useful at all if all it moves is the app itself, because the biggest chunk that takes a lot of storage is data. For example, a game can be 30GB and the app itself only 100MB."
If you get a lot of spam you need call screening and forget everything else. Pixels have this for a couple of years and Samsung got Bixby Text Call integrated into the Samsung dialer. I basically don't have to answer spam anymore.
I use the Z Fold 6 which also uses Hiya. I get a lot of calls identified as suspected spam but some calls slip through. I block the suspected spam calls but my complaint about it is that they're only blocked on the phone. The blocked calls will still ring through on my tablet and my watch. Note that I don't have mobile plans on my tablet or my watch. I would expect to not have any of my devices ring when blocked on my phone.
I get maybe 3 to 5 spam calls a year with hiya.
"I‚Äôve used both on my S series. Hiya caught more spam overall for me, but the Google Phone app felt a bit faster and cleaner to use. Might be worth trying Hiya for a week to see if it helps."
you can install the Google dialer app and have better spam call blocking on Samsung.
"I'm getting a lot of spam with hiya, so If u want good spam detection u might want to use a pixel"
"Hiya seems to block all spam calls for me. As well, having Call Control enabled on your phone account. Call Control essentially requires the caller to identify themselves if they do not have caller ID. if they are unable to identify themselves, like with robocallers, they get sent directly to voicemail, no phone ringing. It blocks multiple calls a day from getting through."
"My honest opinion? A lot of these spam caller things don't actually work even as a former pixel owner.

I still get a lot of phishing calls and collection calls for someone that I've never heard of (Despite having the same phone number since 2005. I still get at least 2-3 calls a week looking for a person who owes money on a 2011 C63). Now that everyone can use a virtual number they just mask to a free number in your area which seemed to work around the pixel spam protection.

What does it determine is spam? My obgyn, my GP, and my Co-workers, even my local CVS pharmacy. I feel like it false positives more than it actually catches. When I had to warranty the pixel for a manufacturing defect... it even considered the call back from its own support line spam...

I just raw dog the phone calls these days as a result."
That's what I'm using.
You make a lot of good points. I may have to raw dog it too.
"I think that the hey google is triggered through your phone's microphone instead of the headphones in most cases, this let's the headphones listen for the trigger"
Google replaced  Google Assistant with Gemini. Nothing more than that.
It means it likely triggers Gemini regardless of what‚Äôs default on your phone.
"Custom noise, less stuff that requires unlock, uses the microphone for voice commands!"
Means some extra AI shit I don't want.
"I can wear.my.headphones and say ""hey google"".

Instead of rolling out gemini support across their platform, they staggered it. And all companies do this so they have something to all about In-between and during releases. 

It isn't impressive because every company is doing it because consumers dont pay attention. 

There is no other reason for this to be the status quo other than marketing and its a big time bummer when you realize that the technological capacities of mankind are gated my marketing firms who projected profit revenue over a century compared to changing today, or, change we can experience merely a few years from now."
"Instead of your phone listening for the trigger, now an AI in your earbuds can listen and tell your phone which ads to push to you while Google sells that info

At lightning speeds!"
K
That I may have to look into BOSE or other brands.
Google doesn't want to miss the listening.
"This is exactly it.  I have the update paired with the Fold 7 and it allows me to use ""hey google"" when my phone is in another room. For those who just got the update and it isn't working, you do have to go into the ear buds settings on the phone, go into voice controls, then click on ""google digital assistant"" to enable."
"I have been using the Galaxy Buds Live for 5 years now and the thing I've always wanted to try was voice commands. Unfortunately it only has Bixby Wakeup and I cant be bothered to setup bixby just for this feature. 

Ive ordered the Buds 3 as a replacement for my aging Buds Live, so Im looking forward to Google Assistant / Gemini in my ear."
professional brainrotters unite!
But what will be different than what already works on the headphones?
"I just switched from an iPhone 16 pro to an S25 Ultra and had a very seamless experience using the smart switch app. Just make sure you turn off iMessage AND disconnect your phone number from iMessage. I was able to import a .csv with my iCloud passwords to Google passwords. All but like 2 of my apps transferred, all my photos transferred, and all my files.

Oh and if you have airpods, remove them from your findmy otherwise the case will start randomly beeping after a while."
"Just switched and have a great experience! Everything, literally everything transferred in less than an hour using a usb type c port, every message, every photo, every note and etc. Just a tip when you'll use Smart Switch make sure when you transfer and it'll show ehat it'll transfer screen, there will be messages, press on it and select for all the time if you want so or it will automatically transfer only the messages for last 30 days. All the videos, photos etc transferred with correct dates and even the apps downloaded the ones I had on my iPhone 15. I switched from iphone 15 to S25 Ultra. I love android and you wont regret it. Especially if you live in US and imessage is popular here, with new RCS I have exact same imessage but much prettier and easier to use. I can send high res photos videos, gifs, see read receipts and delivered. Did not lose anything but won.
Edit: Also dont forget to go to Deregster iMessage website and put your phone number there so you will not have interference with you texts down the road."
"I switched from the 15Pro max to the s25 ultra earlier this year. Minus a few minor things the experience has been really fluid, one UI is pretty similar so it's easier to learn."
Welcome to apples walled garden leaving can be quite hard certain apps that use apple id to create account cannot be transferred.
"Smart switch/transfer didn't work at all.  Had to go to the  carrier to transfer the SIM card.  Nothing compatible went from one phone to the next, had to done everything manually."
Easy peasy. I have both phones and use them.
"Don't get a flip phone if you drop ya phone  or have heavy use...I had a flip 6:...broke on me 4 times...just not durable and yes I understand phone can break when dropped....also the other issue is I use my phone ALOT. I'm a inspector so I am on it alot....I will never go back to flip...I like my oneplus12 pro..it is drastically better and it's been almost a year and not a single scratch on it. Plus was way cheaper...

If you don't use your phone ALOT..it's not a bad phone...just didn't meet my needs was way to fragile"
"My experience was awful nothing really transferred but contacts some text some photos. Do yourself a favor backup your photos with Google or some alternative, make sure to use an app to backup texts. And if you're like me write down the apps you would like to use on android and there may be a chance it's supported on android. Other than that welcome."
"Not the best experience. Went from a 16PM to S25U back in Feb, all of my WhatsApp photos had a timestamp of the date and time I switched rather than the date it said on my iPhone. Swapped from the S25U to the Z Fold7 and it's even more fucked up. Luckily I still have the backup of my iPhone so have to import them back to the Z Fold one by one.

Other than that issue, the messages etc all went over seamlessly"
"It can be quite challenging but way more manageable than in the past. 

Honestly, the hardest part in switching from iPhone to Android is getting used to the new environment, UI/UX, and many other things. 

That made contemplate to switch back to iPhone because something just feels off. But I just decided to suck it up and just make do on what I have on android. Now, I enjoy it more than ever and never looked back."
"I did this switch today for my partner. Use Samsung smart switch and make sure you use a physical cable which gives you more options to transfer over more data i.e. WhatsApp messages, apps etc"
Smart switch will make you're life so easy. Also don't forget to turn off iMessage and rcs on the iPhone so that you'll get all your messages. Sometimes the transition period with messages is awkward.
It was pretty easy for me. I went from an iPhone 15 Pro to a Samsung 25+. The Smart Switch was great!
"I recently did the opposite and switched from Samsung (S23 ultra) to the iPhone 16 pro max and had issues with texts not transferring and some texts that did transfer somehow got created into new text groups. Pictures transferred but started filling up iCloud and then I had to buy extra Google storage as a backup for all the pictures on my Samsung phone (never used Samsung cloud, so everything was stored on the phone )."
Google 1 buy the subscription and back up everything before switching
"I think it‚Äôs pretty easy these days. I went back and forth between them over the years. 

In 2013 I went from a jailbroken OG iPhone and Motorola KRZR to a Galaxy Note 2. Had all my contacts backed up through Google and always kept those contacts updated in case I had to switch back. It wasn‚Äôt too bad to switch but not as easy as it is today. 

In 2019 I had to switch to the iPhone SE due to my Note 5‚Äôs screen having serious problems and my Note 2‚Äôs screen shattering. The SE was $100 and the cheapest, good phone I could find at the time. Kinda jarring to go down to such a small phone. 

2022 I was gifted an iPhone 13 Pro Max and bought a used Z Flip 3 real cheap. It was so easy to go from the iPhone to Samsung now. Almost everything can be transferred now. I currently use both an iPhone and a Samsung together."
Live Photo‚Äôs will no longer work
"The only difficult part for me was moving my photo library, as both Samsung Gallery and Google Photos handle albums differently than iCloud Photo Library does. Smart Switch can transfer them all over from one device to the other, but you'll have some trouble if you wanna keep most of your photos backed up in the cloud rather than stored locally. No matter what I tried, the OneDrive backup built into the Samsung Gallery app wouldn't maintain my albums, and Google Photos wouldn't do it at all. I'd recommend just transferring your entire library to Google Photos, then (using a Mac ideally) manually download important albums one at a time from iCloud and create them manually in Google Photos. 

Aside from that, it should be pretty easy. iOS and Android play a lot nicer with each other than they did in the past lol."
"bro don't do it, I switched from the iphone 14 to the flip 7 just a couple of days ago and you know the phone itself is a masterpiece compared to apple, but the battery... it's f\*\*\*\*\*g terrible, it's flying away just in front of my eyes in 2 hours it's consumes 30%, I charge it 2 times a day and it's new and has a battery 1100 mah more than my old iphone. Moreover, the old Iphone with a battery wear of 82% holds longer than the new flip!!!"
Its a pain in the ass... but about 2 weeks of it
"Switching from iOS to Android is as painless or as painful as your level of immersion in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. If your usage revolves around Apple Music and little else, the transition is straightforward: the primary inconvenience is repurchasing apps you previously bought on iOS, as most apps need to be purchased again for Android.

However, if you rely heavily on Apple exclusive apps like Pages, Keynote, or strictly Apple‚Äôs iCloud services without integrating Google services, which is increasingly rare even among the most loyal Apple users the process becomes more frustrating. Converting or exporting existing work, syncing documents, and maintaining continuity across devices can be a significant headache.

For my own setup, I‚Äôve been a Galaxy S phone user and iPad Pro user for over six years. Apple Music works seamlessly across platforms, making the audio transition effortless. Apple Photos, synced with Google Photos, ensures that even the rare times I snap a photo on my iPad, it‚Äôs instantly available on my phone without extra steps. In other words, thoughtful cross platform use of services can dramatically smooth the transition from iOS to Android.

Colleagues often ask me, ‚ÄúWhy not just use an iPhone so you don‚Äôt have to deal with all that manual setup?‚Äù The truth is, iOS and iPadOS are essentially the same ecosystem. iPadOS only recently got its own name, and even then, the differences from iOS are mostly limited to features like Split View and the dock for multitasking. Beyond that, it‚Äôs largely a carbon copy of the iPhone interface.

don‚Äôt want two identical devices. If I were going to use an iPad the same way as an iPhone, I might as well find a workaround to make calls on the iPad too but that defeats the point. I prefer keeping devices distinct in purpose and experience, rather than duplicating functionality across hardware.

iPad pro is my media consumption device when I want a larger screen, yes large video with minimal letter boxing unlike the galaxy fold which is a horrible 3.75:3 aspect ratio ( nearly square ) which makes video content negligibly large than the S25 ultra. Sure some argue ‚Äúbut you can multitask with the extra screen‚Äù. Yes but I don‚Äôt do that, hardly ever, even on me 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro I‚Äôm using Split View maybe 10% of the time."
"That‚Äôs awesome thank you for your perspective! The only apple services I use are Apple Music and iCloud storage, but I also have Google 1 with my family so I can sync to that no problem. I do have an iPad too, it‚Äôs getting older but is still receiving all updates for now. And I have an Apple Watch, but it‚Äôs pretty jacked up so I‚Äôm probably just going to sell it cheap and use a galaxy watch, make my life easier. I‚Äôve definitely noticed that the iPad is basically just a big iPhone, I only got it because there was a big sale and I had been wanting something to make digital art easier."
"My switch was a nightmare and so are many other people's I have heard of this.  I wouldn't trust the ""seamless"" people LOL there is just no way even in the best of circumstances.  It was a lot of work and thank God I am out of the iPhone trash ecosphere.  So the switch while a pain in the ass, was worth it .  Android is just so much more advanced that iOS."
Kinda excited this is happening a lot more lately that apples gone stale!
That sounds amazing thanks! Is switching off and disconnecting iMessage pretty simple? I‚Äôm sure I can find a walkthrough online
"To add to this, the physical transition from an iphone to a Samsung today is fairly painless.  As in, just the set up is easy to do in order to make the phone run.  

The hard part is really learning an entire new ecosystem, plus the HUGE amounts of customizations that the Samsung phones can do --especially when you start to use Good Lock.   The learning curve is steep but it's only as far as you want to take it."
Oh my god ! Was just scrolling this post and the AirPods part explains why my AirPods randomly beeped when I switched to android for a while !!
"Thank you, will do! I have an iPad still that is connected to my iMessage so at least if I have any issues there I can still find the missing messages but i definitely won‚Äôt forget to deregister this time lol"
"Do you like the control panel in Galaxy devices? Personally I felt like Apple did it better as far as customization / aesthetics (though moving around control buttons is clearly superior on Samsung / Android). Just curious your experience. Also, does Samsung have a good competitive alternative to Dynamic Island that functions as good or close to the same as Dynamic Island? I personally love the feather and am nervous about the possible switch down the road."
"I‚Äôve only done that on an app or 2 thankfully, I always try to use Google to make accounts."
"Not sure why that happened for you. I used smartswitch over 15 times in the last year to transfer between phones and it never failed, transferring over 700gb of apps, messages, settings and media went without any hiccup."
I have a family plan but most of our storage is taken up by our photos lol
"Can you explain why it was a pain? I know that people have issues if they miss steps or do things wrong. You‚Äôre the only person on my post that‚Äôs said they‚Äôve had issues, and I can‚Äôt find anyone else through Google and Reddit searches that have had issues within the last couple years either. Not counting it out that it just didn‚Äôt come up in my searches either, hence making the post. More info would be great."
Yes just a couple taps in iPhone settings.
"Not the guy you replied to, but I just use OpenBubbles to keep iMessage and everything working on android. It's simple to setup and will keep your email active with iMessage (or phone number for a low monthly price). It's great because you don't ruin any group chats you're already in and it makes it easy if you ever do go back to iOS.

Also supports all the latest iMessage features (even iOS 26 ones like backgrounds and group chat typing indicators) and also has FaceTime support, which is huge for me. I've been using it for well over a year now with zero complaints."
"Honestly I think it will be a bit easier for me because 1) I used Samsung for the majority of my life, even if not recently and 2) my entire family also uses Samsung and I often will grab their phone and use it real quick, so I‚Äôm not completely new to the UI at leas"
And the lengthy hours just for choosing themes ü§≠
"I was used to IOS having the control panel in a more vertical space if that makes sense. So reaching some buttons feels off and I'm not too fond of how you answer/decline calls or how you access the controls from the lock screen but it works. 

They have a now bar which is similar to the island."
Yea I'm not sure why either but hey I got a fresh install phone thats rare
"Not the one you replied to, but I recently tried to switch from my iPhone 16 Plus to a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and my switch was also a pain in the ass.
I tried it with the Switch App and it got stuck 2 times. I needed to format the Samsung and try it again. It then worked but my pictures I received via WhatsApp were completely out of order and not chronically saved.
My WhatsApp Backup needed 3 tries to download. Once I got that, I noticed that some contacts didn‚Äôt make it on the Samsung.

After that I noticed that I wouldn‚Äôt get notifications from some social media apps. I needed to redownload them. 

All in all it was a real pain in the ass. I‚Äôm not very patient and it really stressed me out. I switched back to my iPhone, I regret that now and wished I would‚Äôve given it more time."
And it works independently (don‚Äôt need any Apple devices)?
"I believe that you do at least need a Mac for one time activation. That‚Äôs needed to run the OpenBubbles Mac app which is just a QR code you scan on the OpenBubbles phone app to activate it with iMessage. Once that‚Äôs done the Mac can be completely offline.

I could be wrong, but I think if you pay for OpenBubbles hosted service ($16/month) that includes Mac activation. I‚Äôll check on this and get back to you."
"Ah okay thanks. I do have an old MacBook I could use. 

What‚Äôs truly holding me up on making the switch is my Apple Watch that was new in February of this year"
"I never stop using mine even when I switch. It still works great for workout/sleep tracking, you really just lose out on notifications. I believe on the newer watches Siri runs locally for alarms/timers so that will still work, and Apple Pay on the Watch also works without needing a connection.

I still use an iPhone as my daily but am getting a Z Fold 7 due to good trade in deals on T-Mobile ($1100 for an iPhone 11 Pro is crazy). If not I‚Äôd likely just wait until next year when Apple comes out with the iPhone Fold. I‚Äôll be getting that day 1."
"Interesting, thanks for the insight! 

I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd buy a gen 1 version of *anything*, Apple or not. So it‚Äôs more like waiting a couple more years realistically for me.  

And yes, that‚Äôs a crazy good trade in deal! Jealous."
"Mine hasn't learned squat, it still thinks I speak in cursive üòÇ i use it almost daily."
"Good question, not really sure"
"I've had mine for a year or so, not much learning on the Samsung's part. On the other hand, \*I\* have learned to pronounce words so that it spells them correctly - e.g. overenunciating. I have a Midwestern dialect, so not a lot of twang, but a little."
"samsung might store dictionary additions, but not adapt to your voice. uniconverter helps by keeping your corrections in later outputs."
I wish
Good point hahah. I feel like I have learnt to do the same
I actually wish there was a way to look at all of the dictionary entries and edit/add to them for the autocorrect to reference to
How about the Flip 7? Same durability?
"Slime! The key to durability! And Titanium, always Titanium."
"After using the Fold 4 for three years and having the inner screen fail twice, I will never pay for another Fold. The first time the screen failed, I was on my first year of using the phone, and it was repaired under warranty, but the second time my warranty had expired. It's unacceptable for a phone I paid so much for to fail twice in 3 years of ownership despite constant care. I got back to a slab phone."
"No IP67. 

Tiny battery for a ""tablet phone""

Missing periscope lens

S-Pen: Gone  
  
Samsung executives: Compromises were made for thin phone

Price: Jacked up despite major compromises? You ok?"
awesome
"I can attest to the lack of durability. The 7 is my 4th fold and set a record with a complete inner screen failure on the 16th day. Sent to an authorized repair shop and they can't fix it. I was told it's a defective phone. Dig around reddit and you'll find more people with my expience.
Worse yet is Samsungs complete lack of customer service."
what durability? lol
The fact that they have to try so hard to sell us on the durability of foldable phones should tell you all you need to know.
Fold 4 and below had super high failure rates (>40%). Fold 5 onwards have failure rates about the same as slab phones (~5-6%). Data: https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/s/aymAEtNdCo. They really have got more durable.
"They are getting there. They most likey don't want to get the IP rating for dust resistance. Most probably next year, they will.  
Makes sense but do remember fold 7 has the largest main cam of any fold rn.  
Also, 5x periscope makes no sense at all. Just use a larger decent 3x and we are fine.  
S-Pen gone is really a big bummer. Makes ton of sense on a larger display like Z Fold.

  
My whishlist for Fold 8  
\- A larger 3x with ALoP.  
\- S Pen support.  
\- 5000 mAh battery.  
That's about it."
And yet best selling flip and fold. Barely anyone cares about the s pen. Hopefully they completely remove it from the ultra next year.
The IP rating is meaningless. It's just there for fancy marketing.
Where's your Fold?
Meanwhile Samsung foldables are the only ones that have survived JerryRigEverything's durability tests
A company advertising improvements? How *dare* they. I can't believe Samsung is the only one doing this!
Its thinner than previous models and still passed jerryrigeverything's test. I don't see anything else they could market as it's just a minor improvement.
Well I think the point is that it was a big issue in the earlier models so they are pointing out the improvements
...that they used to be bad but now they're good? Idk what your point is.
Because there's a stigma that they aren't but this one is so they are letting people know?
"But isn't that a good thing that they are showing consumers that they are always working to improve the durability, and specifically the improvements for the latest Gen? That's the only way consumers will know that the new fold is more durable. What are they supposed to do? Not tell us? Then wouldn't consumers just keep assuming it's bad like the fold 1?"
"Exactly, I don't care what they say.¬†


When they are offering a 2 year warranty on screens. Then we will talk.


If they not putting their money where their mouth is, and expect consumers to pick up the bill for screen replacements when these fail, that tells you all you need to know.¬†"
"If you have look at this kind of data to see if the phone is durable than that doesn't inspire any confidence on folding phones does it? Who wants to pay that much money and live with constant fear of failure? If they're so confident in their product they can offer 4 years of warranty on the foldable phones. But still they might not honor that warranty because of stupid stuff like scratches on the hinge and stuff like that. Too much trouble for that kind of money if you ask me. Just look at the fold sub and you can already see bunch of complains about the fold 7. From easily scratched phones to inner protector bubbling already.

Ps : I'm still using Samsung. Had a Note 20 Ultra before Fold 4, now I got a S24 Ultra which is very similar to my old Note 20 Ultra. I loved the Fold 4 and I'm sad that it gave up on me and seriously considered getting a Fold 7. I didn't have the heart to pay that much money again and and live with the constant fear of something going wrong with the phone again."
"True for the camera but definitely would help if fold8 is IP67 is certified for durability. 

Some reports report that SiC batteries might not have the same charging lifecycle as Li ion, being the primary reason Samsung is reluctant to integrate that in their phones.

Id be happy if they match the battery longevity and capacity of Ultras in Foldable, and if not make it enough to last 1 day on a full charge.

My friend recently got fold 7 and it barely lasts 1/2 day of use with photos, any heavy tablet style work outdoors at auto brightness. That's what I don't want in a $2000 phone. To constantly charge it multiple times a day"
what colour is your fold?
"his durability tests are in the moment, durability and longevity are way more important as in if that z fold could last 3 years, at least"
"Making screens durable ‚ùå

Continuing to make easily breakable screens and offering free replacement ‚úÖ"
"I guess you could say the same about vehicle safety, pharmaceutical drugs, degrees, the level of various chemicals, and literally everything else. If you can't trust data. Then life is pointless."
Silver shadow
It's common sense that If it doesn't last in the moment it won't last in 3 years
"his tests are no different than the one's that the manufacturer do anyways. Other than, he's not using multi-million dollar multi-pre-calibrated units that ars designed for durabillity testing.Zack's testing's is the most realistic, without being the most realistic."
"with all the stuff he does to phones, they could stop working literally hours after a video or days and we wouldn‚Äôt know, his videos are like 20 mins.
just because it passes the test doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll last over time which is the case for a lot of these flip/fold phones. though im not sure if its just defective from factory devices or people being careless with them"
"my only problem with it is how there‚Äôs no way a phone like a flip or fold could survive one of those tests beyond his usual 20 mins video or even last more than 2 years, at most. not hating, just how i see it from the things the users say as well as the obvious fragile form factor"
"I mean most users are not doing the things ye does to those phones, they'll maybe drop the phone a couple of times over the years, will almost never actually try to bend the phone on purpose so I don't see why his tests are not indicative."
"And in the year 2032, AT&T customers might be able to download and install UI 8. Maybe, don't quote me. 

Love Samsung. Dislike how AT&T treats Samsung customers."
Might give it a try. Not like it can be much worse than UI7.
Bootloader lock in Oneui 8 (even on international models) means no go from me. Shame.
Is it safe to wear a Samsung ultra watch if I have a implanted medtronic defibrillator?
"And in classic Samsung fashion, they can't give a more specific timeline than a week lol..."
"Can't say that I love Samsung. They ruined my phone's battery life with UI 7 and I'm hoping that UI 8 fixes it. 

Even if UI 8 fixes it, the fact I had to wait months for them to fix a problem they caused is not something I will let slide."
"Hard to imagine how that implant would be interfered with the watch, the worst the watches do is connect to Wi-Fi/LTE, and flashes the light to get the reading on your heartrate and such, the magnets are only on the puck chargers."
It's been a big upgrade for me on the s25U
"What does it mean? 
Samsung servers crashed?"
"I could be wrong but the streaming apps connect to their own servers not Samsungs. However every single Samsung tv I have owned has had crappy wifi cards that always end up failing. 

Not so much an issue for me as I use an AppleTV however my tvs constantly drop from the SmartThings app due to connectivity."
Ok good to know I‚Äôm not the only one. This happened last week and now similar thing for me as well but it‚Äôs saying I have no network connection when I know I do
Could you please provide a capture-image of the current symptoms?
Everything is working fine again today but I didn't try it until 11 AM.
Was working 15 hours later when I next tried it.  Been working since then.
We haven't had any issues.
"Servers were back up that same night but didn't check til the next day.

If you have not logged into Samsung smart hub using your Samsung credentials on the TV during setup or changing settings afterwards then you probably would not be affected. I really think only the TLS Authentication is affected when the Samsung servers go down so that you cannot connect to any of the apps you have installed but that is just an observation based on my technical past in I.T."
It‚Äôs down again!
"https://preview.redd.it/dpse3d8bhzif1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd6f55a5036a9902eb8616356ab5672b38f3e02c

Me with 2015 smart tv has the same problem samsung app doesnt work only netflix"
Hello Apple TV.
"All TVs that support Samsung Smart Hub require some sort of connection to the Samsung servers to properly function and connect with streaming apps. When the Samsung servers crashed last week everybody's SmartHub equipped TVs stopped working for streaming apps and many people tried to reset their TVs and got stuck at the terms and conditions page.. Once the servers are working then all streaming apps will work fine again.

It was a worldwide outage last Thursday.  Not sure about this time."
SmartHub equipped Samsung TVs seem to require the connection to Samsungs servers for streaming apps to work at all. Its possible they are providing some sort of web authentication for every connection to a streaming app.
"If it ever happens to you again in the future which I imagine it's going to happen again soon, do not factory reset your TV as you will not be able to get past the terms and conditions page and tell the Samsung servers are back online."
All streaming apps will fail to connect.  You might see snippets of browser errors depending on app.
Still working for me in the midwest.
So they are still not working?
They need to optimize the app. Its slow and sluggish to navigate it
"The only improvement it needs is for Samsung to communicate with banks so they can work with this; it's useless in Ireland, for example."
"Google wallet just works perfectly. Why change?

Google assistant aswell, bixby is rubbish."
This is good
The best improvement for Samsung Wallet would be a return of MST
The best upgrade they could do to the Samsung Wallet is to allow linking Samsung Pay+ cards to Google Wallets. :)
"Can't use it with paypal, my existing bank account or existing credit card. Why would i bother using it at all.

Google Wallet > Samsung Wallet"
"No one reads the article anymore. The new improvement is about¬† additional antenna.




Nothing to do with the software Samsung Wallet. If anything Google Wallet will eventually benefit for this."
"as a new zealander, this doesn't mean anything.. make it available here please"
"I got burnt by Samsung Pay/Wallet a couple of times. Basically it'll stop working until you update the app. I got stuck at the train gantry a few times because of this, and it's an introvert's worst nightmare. 

Even if it's working normally, I still have that lingering doubt that one day, it'll fail me again.

I switched to Google Pay/Wallet and never looked back. It has not failed me in years even once."
I just need MST
"Or get rid of your shitty apps that Google already makes better. We want more integration, not a separate walled ecosystem"
first bring it to more countries
"I would rather it bring a bluetooth s-pen, bigger battery, base storage of 512gb/1tb and max of 1.5TB or 2TB, and a 10x optical telephoto.

You know, the first improved phone since the S23U."
No reason to ever use it when Google Wallet exists.
[deleted]
"I have experienced intermittent functionality issues with Samsung Pay/Wallet, specifically requiring application updates to restore service. This has resulted in inconvenient situations, such as access challenges at transit facilities.

Despite normal operation, a persistent concern regarding potential future failures remains.

Consequently, I transitioned to Google Pay/Wallet, which has provided consistent and reliable service over an extended period."
they need to make Samsung Photos be included into the Samsung Backup
"I can never pay with Samsung Wallet. Every time I try the payment doesn't go through. When I used Google Wallet, I have no issues at all."
"If they don't expand support to more countries. Every upgrade isn't that impactful.
Currently staying in the Netherlands"
I was wondering why more Android OEM's didn't place an NFC antenna at the top. Seems obvious. But absolutely insane that Apple was granted a patent for antenna placement.
"The NFC isn't the issue. Start with getting bombarded with ads and ""deals"".
The add self made passes like both Google and Apple pay.
Port your Samsung internet to windows so we can use Samsung pass and wallet on the desktop. No one want to use a solution u have to figure out how to use on other platforms"
Could be my imagination...but I think the NFC reader worked better on my s23u than it does on my s24u and my s25u.
"Do t care, do t use it, make the damn charging faster if your going to keep this small battery size the same."
"Yup. I like using it to earn points, but they really need to optimise it, it is a first party app after all."
"Same in the Netherlands all the banks got in bed with Google Wallet after they stopped making their own apps.


I am torn: Google works well on the other hand it is an American company we are all fucked if Trump throws another tantrum."
"There's a small difference between them. Google pay send your card to google servers which returns with a different card number so you can safelly pay with nfc. Samsung wallet stores your card data on a physical chip and uses knox to encrypt the card data, so, it's ""kinda"" safer than google pay, due to this, you can also spend a very long time with no internet connection and still use samsung wallet with no problems. In theroy, the best safest mobile wallets are: 1- Apple pay, 2-Samsumg pay, 3- Google pay.

But yeah, samsung wallet app sucks, so I just use the google one LMAO"
"I can't tell you the reasons, but Google Pay fails payment half the time when I try to use my spanish bank card abroad. Samsung Pay works 99% of the time.   
  
I had a non Samsung phone for a trip while mine was in a screen repair that got delayed, and Google Pay made me suffer"
Agreed. I never bothered with Samsung wallet on any of my devices. I always used google wallet cause it worked better and with more banks. Samsung wallet always felt like a relic with a bad UI.¬†
I'm surprised anyone uses Samsung pay. What's the benefit? The one time I tried it spewed advertising at me in Korean - no thanks.
"Samsung Wallet is a legacy product and they have been retooling it to be the one stop security shop by combining NFC payments with a password manager. 

More importantly though this change will benefit Google Wallet and any other NFC payment app on the Galaxy S26 since it's hardware change."
Google wallet got uninstalled. Why would anyone use Google wallet over Samsung wallet especially if they need a password manager? If it's available with your payment or country.
No it doesnt
Who even uses MST anymore? I dont even remember last time I swiped a card outside of ATMs which MST never worked anyway.
What is MST?
"As cool as that feature was. I can't remember the last time I had to swipe my card, like using the magnetic stripe and not the chip built in. Granted, I live in Canada not the US, so our banking system is more up to date, as we made the technology switch in cards much sooner than the US did."
"Fully agree, especially if they are adding a second module, why not bring it back!"
Kinda useless now - even Amish stores now have card readers with nfc payments
How ancient is MST though? I'm 26 and have never even heard of my parents using it. I've only seen people swipe their card in movies.
Same as my experience. Went to pay at the petrol station and it required an update so i was stuck unable to pay. I haven't used it since
Where do you live that MST would still be used?
"100%

Make 1tb the base model and 2.5tb as the max. 

I would 100% preorder it on day 1."

"it's a different position

the antenna on s24 and s25 is on the side of the camera, not in the middle of the phone"
"I'm so ready for a new phone, but I want to be wowed by hardware or tech and not AI or less features.

It's been about 2 years and I'm still waiting for Samsung, Google, etc. to move the bar."
Are the coupons worth it on there? I always see it but never bothered to use it
"Exactly, we are giving too much of our lives to the US, EU should have alternative wallets. Samsung is missing a chance here, probably because they are making so much money, they don't have to care about ""small"" things like this."
"So I'm Swedish and my bank is a fucking G. They have Apple, Google and Samsung (i.e the most popular). But then they have fucking Garmin and Fidesmo (what even is Fidesmo) and you get Apple and Google from 13, Fidesmo from whatever age and Garmin and Samsung from 16. And most big banks in Swedish have the same that I know of."
"Got my first smart watch galaxy 5 pro, and Google just works. Bixby was terrible, but Google assistant gets it right every time. If it ain't broke, don't fix it..."
I've never had any issues using Samsung Pay.
"To be honest, I didn't even try Samsung pay. Set up Google wallet and assistant and never looked back.

I don't know whether it's a regional thing or not, but England, hsbc and rbs debit cards work flawlessly.

Maybe Samsung pay works great in South Korea and that region?"
"As far as a password manager is concerned, you're probably best off with a third-party open source one, especially one that can work with all your devices, mobile and otherwise. Bitwarden is my recommendation."
Because Google wallet can be migrated to any phone in future.
I've never had the desire to try Samsung wallet because Google works great. Is there any advantages in missing?
Yes it does
Yes it does.
Walmart is a big one.
I use mystical space typhoon all the time... Wait wrong subreddit
A lot of shit ass gas stations where I live require a swipe.
That's specious reasoning. The opposite happens where I see people swiping cards all the time and rarely use their phones to pay
A tech that samsung had. It allowed Note20 and older to pay at any terminal that took cards.
Mystical space typhoon
Exactly.

Transit Cards on Galaxy Watches

And until recently, Google Pay did not support custom IDs/passes.

You cannot trust Google, in the past decade Google Wallet has gone from google wallet, android pay & google pay send,  g wallet, google pay back to g wallet (as a beta test) and now google wallet.

Meanwhile, Samsung pay just rebranded to Samsung Wallet."
As big as Walmart is you'd think they could get up to date.  My local stores still can't do Tap to pay.

"I am guessing this is very locale specific. I actually don't see people swiping their cards either. It is all touchless or phone. In fact I am starting to see more and more terminals where there is no magnetic reader to begin with.

I don't have any credit card right now (and I have many) that doesn't have NFC in it."
That's how Samsung Pay works tho
"I was Samsung forever, still had to do crap to migrate cards to a new Samsung. Installed Google wallet before I moved to pixel... 

Moved and my g-wallet moved seamlessly."
">On Z Flip Cover screen

I own a Z Flip 7 and have used Google Pay from the cover screen?"
"They like to do everything in house. They don't like to be dependent on others, which is why they do not support traditional tap to pay wallets of any kind and want you to use the Walmart app for Walmart pay or their own OnePay wallet.

They want vertical integration."
MST uses hardware to send out a signal to terminals to think the card had been physically swiped.  Samsung stopped including this hardware at some point.
Mine automatically transfers over because it's backed up with the Samsung cloud. I never use smart switch so i have to adjust the shortcuts which isn't a big deal.
"I have had bad luck with it. Also, it didnt work on the fold inner screen until the google fold was announced."
I had it backed up on account as well and my bank still requires I re-input the card.
"That's odd, maybe credit cards and debit cards are different. I don't use my debit card on there."
"Costco mastercard, rbc cash back card, and rbc debit card.

All three require being verified again to activate on a new Samsung device.

Don't get me wrong, the added security is actually a good thing."
No issues here.
Zero problems here
"What is actually ""down""?

My two sets are fine. They both are connected to the internet, but they aren't signed into anything - I'll never do that with the TV itself. They both have FireTV sticks and those are working and playing just fine."
"Had issues couple days ago: Turned on TV and gotten multiple network error messages.  Had issues connecting to some streaming services.  The date seemed to be messed up affecting some streaming services.  Finally just unplugged and plugged the power cable after screwing with things for 10 min, and things went back to normal."
is it working for anyone right now or are the servers still down?
"Mine is fine, no problems at all. No issues with any of the apps.The only problem I have been having is with Samsung auto downloading apps I don't want with its update, and clearing apps I do want off the home screen. 
Mine is a QN65Q60CDF."
Samsung Server hub was down. ¬†Only Netflix worked. ¬†Downdetector had it down for almost a day
"Mine is still not working. Tried the resets, Samsung support zero help. Anyone have another fix?"
Thankfully mine is connected to my pc
I was down yesterday but I seem to be working fine today.
"I had issues early yesterday when the MLB app wouldn't connect, but no issues since yesterday afternoon. ü§û"
https://downdetector.co.uk/status/smart-hub/ check this website out downdetector for Samsung smart TVs.
All good here. Using piholeamd
My older Samsung TV was doing this with no Internet connection. But I really don't use the stock TV apps. I have a fire stick connected to it and use that.
I have no issues
I've had no issues with my frame tv
I can‚Äôt get both of mine to play! They just spin
"My TVs work, but SmartThings isn't working right.  S25U/DU8000 TVs"
Have multiple Samsung TVs. My parents who just got a new router is experiencing the issue because they had to reestablish a new Wi-Fi connection. The one at my house which has been running hasn‚Äôt experienced the issue.
Did it fix? Im still having the same issue
"Just plug in a Fire stick or Google TV box and ignore the shit built in OS. You will get more apps, better image quality and faster loading."
"Recently, the television experienced network connectivity issues, displaying multiple error messages. Furthermore, there were difficulties accessing certain streaming services. The date and time settings appeared to be incorrect, which impacted some streaming platforms. After approximately ten minutes of troubleshooting, the issue was resolved by power cycling the device."
"At 8:31 p.m. CST, which is 15 minutes ago the servers must have went down again for the Midwest United States. Nothing works on my TV again and I was watching it when it failed. Fire stick works fine."
Mine is out again 8/6/25
"Im having a issue also, I have Samsung tv‚Äôs with Samsung soundbars on each and the Q-Symphony has stopped working on each and this started on 8-7-25.  The smart things app is working for me."
Mine is working fine for last two days....btw anyone know how much karma I need to post?
It‚Äôs bloody down again I‚Äôm so sick of this!!
my tv youtube app is in a different language and nothing works
No issues on S90D but prolly cause I didn't enable Internet on mine. Prolly a good idea. I'll stream through my Chromecast instead
"I got reconnected but can't download apps max n youtubetv.  I gotta go through YouTube to get to YouTube tv. Minor annoyance, but I would like my max back"
Exact same issue and reboot gateway solved it.
mine is still down. 2020 q70 i believe
This is good. Hopefully mine will start working too soon
"This is almost exactly what I ended up doing.
I am still unable to login with my Samsung account, which is required to install the YouTube app.
So I have switched to just using my XBox as the host for all that stuff."
Right. Same issue.
"Good that you were able to resolve it. My TV is already tired of being reset and restarted and the issue still persists.
I have stopped actually trying for a day now. Getting used to using XBox as my smart hub."
mines still not back. u?
Not sure why this was down voted
"I am in a similar boat. Can't download the YouTube app. The smart hub diagnostics fails with ISP connection blocked error, which started with the outage.

Ended up switching to XBox as my hub and using the TV as a dumb screen."

It's reddit. People are weird.
Have either of you resolved this? When out tv came back up after the initial outage I was able to download a couple of things and figured I‚Äôd just do the rest later. Jokes on me apparently because I haven‚Äôt been able to download anything since
Nope just default apps that are loaded
"I hate when people use ""quantum Leap"" to describe a large change. Quantum is literally the smallest quantity you can use."
Love mine over the 6. Keeping my S25 ultra too. Best of both worlds. But am really loving the cover screen on the fold 7 and weight! It's great in the go!
I had it and yes it's a huge leap forward from last year but I returned it anyway because the front facing camera is just so much worse than the s25 ultra
"Can someone please help explain why is there still no calculator edge panel app (and other edge panel options) on the fold 7? The ultra and FE editions have had these for years, so what's stopping samsung from adding these options to their most expensive flagship phone?"
"Make the inner display at least a 16:9 ratio, so videos actually benefit from the larger canvas rather than being awkwardly cropped. Pair that with Corning‚Äôs aging ‚ÄúWillow‚Äù Glass as the protective layer, eliminating the fragile plastic polymer laminates that currently demand constant care and caution. Until  both of these are addressed, I have no interest in returning to foldable phones. They remain, in essence, no different from the original Galaxy Fold."

I have the ultra and watch ultra. Looking to get the buds ultra as well. Could you tell me if they are any good? I'm addicted to neck bands form factor. Seems like a huge hassle wearing the buds and worrying about them falling out or being stolen
"I was quite disappointed by the Buds 3 Pro. Samsung's new tip setup is almost designed to result in broken eartips because of the flimsy plastic shells they put inside the earbuds. I've broken 2 so far. 

Moreover, they just don't fit securely in my ears no matter which tip size I use. Talking on the phone for more than a couple minutes usually results in them starting to slip out and having to constantly readjust. 

The fact that their multipoint connection only works with Samsung devices is frustrating and inconvenient as well, and bizarrely the microphones seem to not work with non-Samsung Windows PCs. I frequently use my earbuds for making calls through my work laptop and I can't use these for that. 

The sound quality is really excellent, but unfortunately they have far too many design flaws and downsides. I just ordered a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2. I have the first gen of those and the universal multipoint connection is a huge plus for me, and from all the reviews I've seen of gen 2 the wing tip makes for a very secure fit."
"screw ""ecosystems"" it's a fancy word designed to make you commit to one brand, with very little actual upside, especially on Android. I'll go with Samsung phone because they are top tier, but I'll go to other brands for buds and a watch because they work just as seamlessly but are better products."
Samsung Literally has the biggest ecosystem out of any brand
How much did you pay for you watch7? I got mine for $170 at Walmart. 40mm cream color wifi/bluetooth.
Me i have s22U buds fe and watch 7 so i have the trio too my friend! üî•
"Why is everybody hating? Bro, just went with some good shit."
"The Buds 3 Pro have presented some challenges. The redesigned eartip attachment mechanism, featuring delicate plastic components, appears prone to breakage, as evidenced by two instances of failure.

Furthermore, achieving a secure fit has proven difficult, regardless of the eartip size selected. Extended phone conversations often necessitate frequent readjustment due to slippage.

The limited multipoint connectivity, restricted to Samsung devices, is a notable inconvenience, compounded by reported microphone incompatibility with non-Samsung Windows PCs. This limitation hinders their usability for calls via a work laptop.

While the sound quality is commendable, these design shortcomings significantly detract from the overall user experience. Consequently, a transition to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 has been initiated. The universal multipoint connectivity of the original Pixel Buds Pro, coupled with the reported secure fit of the second generation's wing tip design, are key factors in this decision."
"For galaxy watch 7 or any devices: turn off the Always On Display option, it'll prolong the battery life more.

I have Fit3, with Always On Display I have like 2-3 days of battery, while off I have like 4-5 days."
"Nice! Now you have to go with the house gadgets. 

I already started with TV and Minisplit. Using everything from the phone is really awesome."
"When i was buying watch, I selected watch 5 pro over watch 6 due to battery and i am glad that i bought that watch. I can use up to 4 day in light usage"
No Samsung SC50H?

"Door lock, air conditioning, Tv,"
"For Those products im loyal to lg products, lg's products for house have a really good quality and last long"
"Honestly have not been too impressed with samsung's appliances. 

Phone, watch, tablet and buds are good though."
Forgot frame üñºÔ∏è & ring?
They are good better to buy from store or official samsung store as they have the newly manufactured buds. Old ones have few problems.
"Fortunately there are some fantastic third party offerings right now for the tips. I have some rubber ones that are a pretty good replacement, but I got some nice foam ones coming in today that I'm excited for. Samsung really should have fixed that issue though!"
My buds are Lenovo and perfect. I got the Watch7 because it was the best watch at the price point I was looking at.
"Buy Samsung products, then comment again."
Can I know what brands would you recommend for buds and watch? And would you use classic watches instead of smart ones?
I got it for 195 dollars(17000 INR). 44m LTE version from official samsung store app.
Idk man plus I don't care
"I hate the design, crapple wanna be? I prefer buds"
I don't have money man also I already have enough products with sony.
Welcome to the club man buy s25 ultra and you'll love it.
"And their corporate phone systems (although I think they‚Äôre discontinued)

My company uses a shit ton of OfficeServ 7100s"
Can't forget the discontinued steamer closet.
They make tanks to. So make sure to get that also otherwise you're just a poser.
"Were they flagships?

Because this kind of reminds me of 'I bought Samsung phone for 10$ and it was shit' type of posts/comments."
"bruh, I had several iterations of Samsung watches and buds, and then I decided to change because I wasn't satisfied with them. I'm not a sheep which keeps buying whatever big corporation tries to convince me I need to buy."
"I've tried several, my $30 dollar earbuds are 89% of the sound for 10-15% of the price."
"Not bad! Do you like the default strap? I feel like it hurts my wrist, but I got 3rd party one on amazon for $10 so it's all good."
"Well, I guess it just comes down to personal preferences"
"Yeah, I don't either, that's why I only have the TV and the minisplit, yet, but I'm making the effort."
They also make parts for many other devices. Only the ones who got these are true fans
And guns that automatically aims at its designated target
I'm satisfied lol
It is okay for me. But planning to buy a new one. For now I have to adjust with this. Can you share the link for the strap?
"Definitely, most people like them. I always had Sennheiser buds, so it's hard to transition. For girls, it can get in the way of hair and earrings. I really dont like how it resembles airpods. They do look cool in black."
They made screens for iphones so I guess by that guy giving up his Iphone he is outve the samsung ecosystem
"I never said you shouldn't be, ""lol"". I just wrote that speaking of ""ecosystems"" is exactly what these tech companies want you to do, it plays into their business."
"Oh yeah, I couldn't have agreed more . I'm using the HD800s, and I can confirm the difference in sound and stuff . If I got the Hd800s before my buds, maybe I'd be indifferent"
"Okay, coming to your point, sometimes I don't take my phone. I just take my buds and my watch, which is LTE, which is fine for me to listen to music and attend calls. Tell me now which brand I should use if I need the above requirements."
"Any bluetooth headphones will connect to your watch, I do it with my cheapo $20 Anker buds."
These things are so insanely expensive wow
"For people who say it's going to easily break. I have the 6 gen, and I've dropped it a good amount of times.  On concrete and my tile floor, both screens are still good, no breaks or dead pixels. I have the same basic case I bought when the phone came out. The one that attaches to the top layer and bottom . The only thing that's pretty dinged up is the hinge, and that's it. It has scratches and small dents."
"I ordered an s25u recently. While the device was on order I went into a store and they just so happened to have the display of the fold7. Gorgeous phone - a marvel! I liked it better than the s25u for in hand feel. But two things got me saying no, the inner screen durability and price."
inner screen scratches at a 2. Until they can think of a way to make the inner screen more durable I won't get one.
No s pen support is a deal breaker for me.
"It‚Äôs incredibly well engineered. I‚Äôm not going to buy one because I can‚Äôt quite justify it, but it‚Äôs extremely tempting. 

I‚Äôm also super scared I‚Äôd immediately groove up my inside screen lol"
"I got mine last week. There were tons of pre-order incentives and discounts, bringing it in-line to a regular ""flagship phone"" price. 

It's insanely thin, the cameras are good, it's super fast and fluid, the battery life is pretty good, the UI is extremely polished even maintaining logical consistency between small screen - big screen- DeX, it's crazy how good the experience has been."
"Will take my $2000 devices without a shelf life measured in ""trips to the store in shorts""."
How much yall wanna bet most people comment negatively about fold never use fold before?
Yeah‚Ä¶ this one hits different üòé
"My flip 4 screen died last week. Went into ATT and was able to trade it in for $1100 credit towards the fold 7 and also got a watch 8 for 99 cents (plus tax)... Like $1500 value. I could have also got a tablet for 99 cents plus the tax but didn't really want more crap (now kind of regretting it).

I probably wouldnt have gotten the fold had this trade in  + add in offer not existed but now that I have had it for a week I get why it's so expensive.. probably the most enjoyable phone I have ever had."
"I really wish samsung would stop playing games and finally add the ultra cameras, along with bringing back the udc

re's no point in spending more money for a spec downgrade from the s25 ultra‚Äã"
Yeahhh im not buying a phone that I can scratch the screen with a piece of plastic.  Maybe in the future
I just returned 25 ultra for the fold 7...I love the fold 7...also verzion gave me 1100 off fold 7
Idk... I still prefer my s24+
Mate has one. He loves it
Its insane until you realize the app support for the larger screen is still garbage and you'll be using the outside screen 90% of the time for that reason alone
"Wait what?! I knew it was thin, but this thin damnnüò≤"
That might have to be my next phone.
I like the idea. But being able to permanently damage your screen with a fingernail really sketches me out on buying one.
Unfolded? Fold 7. Folded? S25 Ultra. Love it.
That silver colour is dope I should‚Äôve gone for that damn!!
I'll buy it in about 5 years¬†
What's the battery life like
"Yeah, the price is insance while it also looks crazy as it is almost the slimest fold device."
"Having owned multiple foldable devices, including the Fold 3 and the Honor Magic V2, I find the Fold 7 to be a significant improvement. While the Fold 3's front screen proved to be somewhat limiting, and the Magic V2 presented certain feature limitations and slower Wi-Fi speeds compared to my previous Samsung device, the Fold 7 offers a compelling user experience. The primary concern with the Fold 7 is the battery capacity; however, its impact is mitigated by my current work situation."
Razor thin!
Apparently next year according to Dave2D they'll be getting rid of the crease.
"Nah, I personally prefer thicker phones"
Samsung‚Äôs flip does pretty well with the EU drop tests.
thank you for making the 700th post about it!
7 generations in to have a screen still fragile and can crease worse than other main folding phone brands. Yall getting played from fomo
So I was playing with one at Best Buy and it looked awesome but uh...how do you close the damn thing? I was worried about the pressure it was taking to do it
[deleted]
"It's ""cool"", but for everyone, most people will use the external screen 90% of the time."
I really wish they made the camera bump horizontal like they did on the Pixel. The wobbling when putting it flat on a table is super annoying.
"The Fold 7 is the third foldable I have owned.   First was the Fold 3.   Front screen was too small.  Second was the Honor Magic V2.   Good phone, but there were a few options not available, and my speed on wifi was slower than on my old Samsung.   The Fold 7 is good, except for the small battery.   However, the battery size is not as much as an issue as it would be if I was still working."
Both 2 and 4 screens split for me. No more folds!
Camera bump
Too thin
It really is. The battery life is not too shabby either for being like 4400 mah or whatever   gets me easy 12 hours of continuous YouTube and other goofing all day. Very happy with my purchase
I love the form factor. Hesitant about the battery performance on it. I‚Äôm looking at this and the S25U.
"Regarding concerns about device durability, I can share my experience with the 6th generation model. Despite multiple drops onto concrete and tile surfaces, the screens remain intact, with no breaks or pixel defects. The device is protected by the original case, which secures the top and bottom layers. While the hinge exhibits some cosmetic wear, including scratches and minor dents, the device's functionality remains unaffected."
Im in love too. Work of Art.
"Yup, they‚Äôre crazy thin! It didn‚Äôt feel feeble at all though. I changed my Iphone 16pm for a Fold 7. I lasted 8 or 9 days with it! The Fold 7 is boxed up again waiting to be picked up for return and my 16pm is back on frontline duty! I just couldn‚Äôt get to  love it. I tried! Maybe i‚Äôm just too used to Iphone or something. The Fold just didn‚Äôt cut it."
"Just a little more bend and there it goes..breaks into 2 smartphones   
LMAO"
"I would trade in my S25 Ultra with no hesitation if it had a pen. :/
I love the analog aspect of playing Chess with a pen, or doing little scribbles with a physical piece of equipment in hand, I'd take a camera downgrade and the dust problem for that beautiful phone.. but no pen is a dealbreaker for me"
"I want to like it. It's clearly an improvement over the last, but the unfolded aspect ratio will never sit right with me. Maybe I just dont multitask in a way that would utilize it.

I'm curious how most games handle the ratio change. Starting out, I think most people would think a foldable means bigger screen for better media consumption, but even at full, a 16x9 video isn't really any bigger than it would be on the outer screen.

I think a trifold that opened up to atleast a 16x10 ratio would be the tipping point for me. I just dont see the incentive to fully develop support for a square screen, when even the actual owners won't use it 100% of the time."
"I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I bought the Fold7, so excited. So ready to jump back onto Android. And I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I returned the phone after 36 hours. Maybe one day."
But no S-Pen?
Only thing I got from going to the store was saving myself from getting it. I couldn't look past the bend/dip in the middle.
"They need to add the vapor chamber, built in mag charging, spen support and new battery tech. 2500$ doooo it"
They made the newer phones bigger so that the fold would blow their audience minds. Excellent marketing
does usbc even fit on there or does it use something else lol
Does anyone own a fold 6 or 7 I'm interested in getting one just wondering if you can full screen netflix and youtube with no issues
Its still not there yet. Forget it on your lap and step out the car. Let me know what happens
[deleted]
I want one but yeah I don't have fold money üòÇ
I think you need a note from your doctor to spend that kind of money on a stupid cell phone
"I'm so happy I get to expense my phone, I went ham on the 1TB"
"If the trend of Samsung's foldable value decreasing continues, it might be cheaper after a year"
"If im getting a fold i want it to last me 5+ years

My fold 3 just didn‚Äôt give me that amount of time so i wont be coming back for AWHILE"
"Without carrier deals in the US, I'd be rocking a midrange phone.

Ive been able to spend $50-400 (usually on the lower end) per year for the past 10 years now to have a top tier phone."
"Unless you‚Äôre accounting for inflation from 2019 or you make significantly less money, the base model price has only increased $20 in the last 6 years."
We got ours for 900 each via Verizon¬†
Jerry got really surprised it didn't break when he tried to fold it backward.
"Brother go watched the fold 7 bend test on Jerry's channel. The guy who tears down phones and tech man in fold 7 was super super unbreakable or bendable. Watch this:

https://youtu.be/8hgg4YEdPak?si=5Amg8Ibl2Z5K5gZU"
Yea that's the whole issue if the hinge is beat up you won't qualify for a trade-in.
"Question, does your 6th gen have a prominent crease on the part of the display that folds? And does it become more apparent overtime even when the display is on? I genuinely want to buy a Galaxy Z Fold 7, but I worry about a crease eventually becoming visible after a year or so of use."
"I want to see if it lasts for more than 5 years without a scratch, like my s10e, but i'm taking care of this little beast"
"So for people who think the new thinner version is more breakable, your argument is to say that your older thicker model is just fine. Got it."
My fold 3 is still functioning well mostly intact
"Mileage might vary.

Some people have bashed their foldables around with zero consequences, whereas others have babied them only to find their displays spontaneously shattered or damaged.

The same could probably be said for any phone, because there are so many variables, but these foldables are just inherently more fragile."
You're the only one.
Cant bend glass can you? Atleast at such an angle
"You're right, why didn't samsung re invent the rules of the universe?"
"When the first ones came out I thought, ahh I'll just wait until the sort out that screen in a generation or two..."
"Probably not possible, at least not to the level of glass.


I will say, my fold 6 inner screen looks flawless after a year, folding the phone protects it from scratches"
But what would be the source of such scratches? My Fold 4 never had problems here.
"You really can't, it has to be plastic, if they applied some sort of coating on the screen it will chip off at the seam"
[deleted]
Inner screen has a protector on it... Samsung will replace it once for free ...
I mean the inner screen is protectez most of the time
"the protective film scratches, not the UTG under it?"
Samsung will replace the inner screen protector for $20. Also the first replacement is free.
Agree
Same here.
Unbelievable. I just looked at the prices and they're more expensive than my gaming rig with a 4070super. Wow
Exactly what i was thinking going through these comments. I don't think anyone who's ever used one will say these
"I‚Äôve used all of them up until last year. Cool at first but too many screen issues. With cost of insuring them skyrocketing it doesn‚Äôt make as much sense. Also battery life is crap vs others phones. I actually was forced to transition to an iPhone due to battery dying during a work day. I cannot tether to a charger, do not want portable chargers just to make it through a 9 hour work day. Especially when another device that does the same job gets 2x the battery life for me. It was cool to experience but just doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore for myself and plenty of others. Also pricing is just too much for the average consumer. Lets see if they can actually make one that is less than $1500 and not the flip model"
Of course üòÇ
"Is this reddit version of verified? ""Official""?"
"I had the Fold 3 and it was the complete opposite. Outer screen was only for phone calls or when I had to do something quick and didn't want to bother with the larger screen. Got an insane trade in value on my phone thanks to a Geek Squad discount Samsung offered. I think I got a 1600-1700 trade in credit for my year old S20.

But I walked around work with it open (great for pulling up products and showing people) & had a case that could hold it up to watch videos/stream games on the larger screen. I even had a car mount that fit it unfolded and would have half the screen on apple music and the other half on Google maps. I can't image not finding a way to use that screen as often as possible. 

Buying a folding phone only to use that larger screen 10% of the time just seems like wasted money to me. And honestly every app I needed worked perfectly fine with that screen. Streaming apps, social media, multiple music apps all worked find. Only game via Xbox streaming and that was fine. 

What all has not been supported besides some random mobile games?"
You obviously have no experience. I actually use the inner screen 90% of the time and have no problem with apps.
"Have you had one? I've been using foldables for 5 years, there are very few apps that give me any trouble at all."
"i just wanna pop it open and do actual work with mouse and foldable keyboard, ive been yearning for 7-8 inch windows tablet"
"This was true maybe a few years ago, definitely not now"
"why are you using your fingernail on a regular display, anyways?"
Mine has lasted almost a full day with heavy use. The batt life really didn't sway me though. If I'm at work it's plugged in. Car it's plugged in. So far I'm loving mine and ive had all the foldables since they came out mainly the flip though. This is my second fold.
"Also it makes sense to do a trade in. Especially at the carriers who will give upwards of $1000 even for phones that never have cost $1000. That‚Äôs basically having your phone free for several years, and then making money on it. I always took advantage of the any condition trades from AT&T. Traded in old phones with no real value for $1000 or $800. Then financed the rest. 0% interest financing is a dumb thing to not take advantage of since I won‚Äôt leave AT&T due to the service they provide here being the best"
Why?
Vapor chamber isn't happening at that thinness.
"Nope.  Keep it at 2000.  Negotiate for your dollar.  Don‚Äôt just offer more. 


Imagine asking companies to charge you more.  There‚Äôs a reason some people are endlessly rich and other folks out here renting phones."
[deleted]
That can happen with any phone
I do have fold money but I'm not blowing it on passing fads from Samsung anymore. I've given them too much for too little.
I just have too much other stuff I'd rather spend it on rather than a phone
Yep 2000 dollars twice the price of an iPhone but what do you expect? It‚Äôs foldable and they are tagged for an obvious reason it‚Äôs so hard to make them water resistant and have to use a special rule to keep your screen working when you halfway fold it so yeah that answers your question
"My money don't jiggle jiggle, it folds."
Mister your folding money‚Äôs come unstowed.
got mine for 1100 off with tmobile
Unemployed here who thinks everyone should live a frugal life eating $2 lunches.
"thats the only way I would have even considered that insane price for this device

I've had 2 folds and they were kinda nice, but they are and will NEVER be 2000 + dollars ""nice"""
"Idk why they downvote you man, you are right, paying 2000+ for a device that could break in a year is insane"
"**on a 3 year, overpriced contract**...dont forget that minor detail.."

Plot twist: getting rick rolled
You mean warranty. Hinge damage for trade ins are usually fine unless it's severe
"Tell that to Verizon, they take phones in any condition for their trade ins.¬†"
Good question and I personally dont see it . Unless you are ACTIVELY looking for it it just blends in. If you have the money and are willing to risk it. I 100% guarantee it's worth it.
I have a fold 7 and you basically can't feel the crease its so so much better than previous folds
"I mean, if samsung did it right with Gen 6 whose to say they didnt make it better for gen 7."
"Nope, same experience with me and my dads fold 6s"
[deleted]
"Its just too soon for that, but it'll definitely be possible at some point"
Give us time
"well, If they managed to make glass surfaces but with seamless plastic strip at the hinge it would be huge, but probably it would be very hard to do"
"You actually can, the screen is actually glass inside, they just have a plastic protection layer on the top"
"JRE takes off the screen protector to test the hardness. The top layer of the display has always been a polymer layer (since the OG Fold) that scratches at a 2. Durability has increased over the generations though, so if people just keep the screen protector on, then the display will be fine."
No phone for brokies
"This makes me laugh as every single iPhone person I know is constantly tethered to a charger. I have a charger at my work desk, and all my coworkers are round robin'ing their iPhones on my charger all day long."
What are some apps you use that are foldable compatible?
Imagine having to worry about it?
It makes a great deal of sense for some people. Not knocking it. Makes zero sense to then talk about somebody else's money though. I give my old phones to family.
Yes why!
"The Android OS and the 21:9 aspect ratio on the outside screen.  

The Android OS, specifically One UI, is so unoptimized and I didn‚Äôt remember it being that way. I had a Note 9 and loved it. Then I had an iPhone 12 and 14. I was ready to try Android again. But the swipe gestures weren‚Äôt intuitive. Apps like Chrome and Reddit were worse on Android. Then the 21:9 screen left weird black bars on apps like TikTok and instagram. Then when unfolded, any standard media had massive bars. 

I really liked the folding design, Samsung made an amazing phone. It‚Äôs the software that held it back for me."
"Uhhh, I know.. that‚Äôs ok. Give us the features we want. I mean, thinner was nicer, but I am sure it wasn‚Äôt the leading request"
Swype text. Now should be blow
Lol had pretty much all the samsungs from since they started im at s25 ultra and never happened. Only happened to the folds
"Passing fads? I'm not sure folding phones are a fad, why are they still making them?

Imo folding phones are a welcome innovation in modern smartphones, which had all become the same compact brick design."
well said
"Yeah more like that, if I'm just going to toss 2k at something I can think of at least a dozen things that the money would be smarter to spend on."
how much do you pay a month to tmobile for your cellular service plan?
"Ok. So you're getting a phone, tablet, music player, camera and more. That's portable. And you expect it to be ""cheap"" Just asking. Imagine walking around with a camera, then an iPod, and then your phone. Times have changed. And these companies gonna charge. Especially if it's a brand like Samsung. Their established."
To be fair the 3 compared to my 6 is no comparison in terms of durability. My 6 was still going strong with no issues. And I owned the fold since the 4. The 4 had issues with the hinge. Since then. No problems ever since.
except it's not.  if we paid the phone up front it would do nothing to our agreement. otherwise it added 25 per month for 3 years because that's the 900 that the phone now costs.
Even he refers to himself as Jerry a lot nowadays lol him wanting people to know his name stopped being a thing years ago
Hahaha this made me click and check.
"with the prices they rip people off for with their service, they can afford to take any trade in"
I need to get out of Apple
Flip 4 was way less durable than the 3 but that's generally normal to expect improvements gen over gen.
"I had a s10+, then went into fold, only word of advice is that once you have a fold youll struggle to go back to a normal phone, I got a fold 3 after my s10+

The fold 3 last 3 years, with it being dropped in water, a close call with sand, and my other drops, all with no case, I then got the fold 6. And love everything about it... but I am one of these weirdos who uses the s-pen so the fold 7 not having that is a bummer."
"Making glass bendable would require it to be softer so it doesn't shatter. However, making it softer would make it much more likely to scratch. And at that point, its easier to just use plastic."
"No, no it won't."
"Tbh, this is how I feel. At this point, damn near anything with R&D is possible"
"I think it's to big off a part of the screen, in the middle, for them to be able to do that."
"That are? Just about every single one? 

Be easier to list the ones that aren't, it's a short list. Rakuten weirdly even tells me I can't use it on a foldable if I open the app while unfolded. But if I open the app on front screen then open phone the app expands just fine for foldable"
"Why do you worry about it? Literally no one ever worries about this stuff on a day to day usage. Just like the IP rating, worring about an IP rating and the fingernail scratches is such a severe form of constabtly worrying, that it's not even funny. It's just sad, that includes your comment."
Personal preference.

I think the preorder sales has proved Samsung right on this one.
"What exactly are you trying to say? That a foldable, and only a foldable, is not a good buy,  because *you* dropped one that you forgot was on your lap?"
Everyone will call it an experiment or a fad until Apple invents the folding phone next year.
I‚Äôm not convinced of the strength and durability of folding screens over the course of several years.
About 70 per line
"I paid ¬£1150 which includes 20% tax. 

I only pay ¬£10 per month for my mobile plan"
"all cell phones do all those things, and if you think this thing is like an IPad, you've obviously never had an IPad.."
"What do you pay a month for phone service, taxes and fees included?"
Its a meme because everyone calls him Jerry because of his channel name and he goes with it

Shape-memory alloys that are transparent enough. You're underestimating material science by a lot. It's not yet available doesn't mean it's not going to be available ever.
Why tho? There are many inventions in history that people refused to belive those are possible to make
"i wonder if there's some advanced alien civilization looking at us and thinking ""they STILL haven't achieved DAMN NEAR ANYTHING!""üòÇ"
"I mean, the only thing you would need is to learn how to connect two materials tougher, like:

glass - stitch - plastic - stitch - glass

not that would be easy, but at least like 60-70% of the inner screen would be scratch resistant"
"Ok, but who asked?"
Fair.
I think he dropped every single samsung phone the the exact same way.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ dropped 8 from z flip to fold 3 and up all didn't survive and literally damaged right bear the fold.
"Well yes obviously. The fact that they haven‚Äôt stolen this idea and popularized it speaks volumes. I work in IT and I‚Äôve only seen one person with a folding phone in real life, so I wonder who is buying these in volume if anyone."
"I will give you some insight into reliability based on my own experience.

I got my Zfold 5 2 years ago.  I work in an extreme environment and bring it into very dangerous areas. To be clear, I am a steelman working with a furnace.  The area is wildly hot, dusty, and dangerous. I somewhat regularly work in areas that exceed 200‚Å∞F.

My outer screen is beyond fucked.  Mainly because I dropped my phone on a rough surface a number of times, and it breaks more and more.  It's still totally usable.

My hinge is dented and scratched from drops. The hinge mechanism still works flawlessly.

My inner screen has no issues to speak of.  The built-in screen protector has no peeling or cracking to note.

I have never put a case or screen protector on my phone and, outside of a broken screen (like anyones phone that has been dropped too many times), this thing refuses to die.

Edit: As of August 17th, 17 days after this comment, my inner screen protector began a small peel at the top at the crease!"
"Not to mention how you're getting worse cameras at a higher price + Samsung opting to make the phones thinner instead of keeping the thickness to give room for a bigger battery. 

A bigger battery is much needed with a screen that large in size and high resolution."
"To be fair to Samsung their trade in deals are crazy every single year, when I upgraded to the zFlip5(from the 4) I only paid $100(not including the care plan) and got a free upgrade to 512gb.

Also my zflip5 is 2 years old now and still going strong!  Definitely not for people who are tight on money though just out of concern of the cost to fix or replace one(it's $100 for me to get a replacement phone if this one broke)"
"Moving parts remain the Achilles‚Äô heel of mobile electronics. No matter how much Samsung reinforces the hinge or improves the inner display, mechanical components inevitably wear down over time. Friction, stress, and repeated bending introduce micro damage that static devices without any moving parts simply never experience. Folding phones will always be fighting to have better durability than the last generation, but they will never surpass regular phones."
"no wonder they gave you ""1100 dollars off""

I pay 12 dollars a month per line for cell service; tons of plans all over for 25 bucks a month or less..

THATS how you got your ""1100 off""l tmobile makes that back and a TON more on you over the life of that  ""discounted"" phone"
"My point is not that I never had an iPad. But I do own a Samsung tablet. The point I'm making is that you have a cellphone and also a tablet as one. Try doing certain task on a regular candybar phone and constantly have to pinch to zoom or opening multiple apps at the same time, compared to owning a fold is no comparison. So think about how much you paid for your tablet and also your phone. Just saying"
354 for 5 of us. this includes insurance and unlimited talk text and data plus every phone is still in a state of payback.  Our actual phone plans are 45 per month
Is he the guy that invented the Jerry Can? /s obviously
Exactly. It‚Äôs probably just too expensive to incorporate into the hardware right now‚ÄîI give it 3 years from now when we‚Äôll start seeing this tech on flagship foldables
[deleted]
unless you want to wait 20 years
Learning curve too steep for some
treat your phones better?
folding phones make *you* more clumsy?
"Well, I bought one."
"That‚Äôs wills, thanks for the feedback. Fwiw, I have no idea how you survive in that work environment. I lie in Florida and just being outside now is enough for me!"
"It‚Äôs fascinating and a bit ironic that the physically most fragile component of the Fold, the flexible laminate inner display, remains blemish free, while the supposedly tougher glass front screen and solid aluminum hinge sustain damage. Clearly, in your ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù work environment, the inner display isn‚Äôt getting any real use."
Excellent points. I don‚Äôt like the thin but camera bump trend
They need to switch over to the better batteries Chinese phone manufacturers are using.
"I doubt I'd get anything. 

I'm still rocking a Note 9, I've had it for 7+ years. It has been a GREAT phone but it's no longer supporting some apps (increasingly) and no longer updating the os. Plus the battery is clearly dying.

I'm going to need a new one soon and honestly the thing I'll miss the most is the little *built in* stylus. I use it a lot and the only comparable thing out there I could find is the galaxy s25 ultra.

They are all so expensive I just don't want to make the wrong choice."
"Yeah sure you do, you just sound mad cuz you can't afford the fold 7, stop lying to yourself and people on here, who are you to say what people like and don't like, I pay 80 a month, does that make you upset lmao"
I know people on the cheap cell service and they have issues all the time with service.  I've been with my company for 15 years and I've budgeted the payment well before the smartphones became what they are today.  I got more than half off the phone and with something I use everyday I enjoy what I bought.  To each their own
"I've had 3 folds, and I never felt they were a tablet replacement what so ever; too small to actually use as a tablet, and too big to carry around in many pants pockets.

I didnt mind trying them where they were a TON less expensive, but for TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS+,  not gonna happen..

to each his own.."
">being cheap

Hahaha, do you think a 2000‚Ç¨ phone would care about that ? It also doesn't have to be exactly glass, something flexible with high Resistant for screens will be there in few years 

With the acceleration of Science it's not that far"
"Nah it won't be that far, in last 20 years technology has made much more than that and it's going forward with higher speed 

AI and machin learning , self driving cars, 3d printing, flexible phones, 5g network, etc"
Definitely an issue related to skill
"I am an Arixona native and used to work outside a bit.  Was a minor adjustment, honestly lmao.

I forgot to add to my last comment.

Many people have issues with the inner screen because they clean it with chemicals, and it causes peeling and cracking.  It's the same reason you dont use iso on your TV, laptop, or monitors. it's bad for the plastic.

I usually dry wipe dust off the hinge before opening and to get debris off the screen.  If I need to ""clean,"" I use a damp cloth and wipe it down.  Absolutely no chemicals.  I personally believe that leads to longetivity.  I have seen people complain about peeling and cracking after a couple of months.  If my phone is still alive, I attribute it to avoiding chemicals!!!"
"I open that screen its guaranteed to melt in many instances.  In others, it will get materials on it that would chemically melt it. Or, at minimum, it would cause dirt to sandwich between the screen to imprint when shut.  

The heat I deal with is so extreme that my own clothes have burned me when I shifted.  My phone was in my pocket while I was worried about the screen inside melting and fusing my screen shut. Shifting while standing still caused my own panta to burn my legs. There was one scenario a few months ago where the heat I was dealing with far exceeded 200‚Å∞. Exposed skin cooked.  The only thing between the phone and that heat was my normal regular pants.  The heat has also quite literally melted the soles of my boots.  Hanging out much longer in that heat, my feet begin to cook as well.  The ground is so hot it will ignite wood and other materials that aren't treated to resist ignition. Opening my phone guaranteed melting my screen.  It should have honestly fused while folded in my pocket, honestly.

I have taken videos of materials so hot that when I handle my phone again, it is almost too hot to touch the areas exposed to the material.  Have you ever had 50+ tons of liquid steel get dumped to make a waterfall in front of you?  Likely not.

The environment is dusty.  Like, a week of no cleaning, there is an inch of extremely fine dust/dirt.  So fine, it will make it past the hinge guaranteed.  In some areas, especially ones I pass through, there is airborn lime and other materials I can not mention.  That lime gets on my screen, then I touch with my sweaty hands, and I have created an acid on the inner screen that will melt it chemically.

That all being said, I do open my phone quite a bit.  People outside of this line of work just cannot fathom what the environment is like.  My phone is always in my pocket and at extreme risk.

2 years later and that inner screen hasnt shown signs of wear, even though I do touch it with grimey nasty hands, and everything around me is covered in a fine dust.  I even find that my inner screen has a light dusting that I have to clean off most of the time.  If I swiped with a clean hand, my fingers would come back brown/black.  Why is it pristine?  Because the cleaning agent I use is regular water and a soft rag.  No peeling protector, no cracks forming."
"Do they not make phone cases that hold the stylus?  If you're not able to spend that much right now then that could be another option.

(Everything from here forward is based off what I'm seeing on the samsung app from the states so my apologies if you don't live here because I'm not sure if Samsung discounts are the same everywhere)

From what I searched up the base model of the Note 9 was $999.99 though, so you already spent at least that much 7 or so years ago so if your financial situation hasn't changed much then going ahead with getting an s25 ultra wouldn't be much different.

The base s25 ultra model has 256gb and is $1299.99, and if you trade in your Note 9(and it's not cracked) you'll get $135 off(or $50 if cracked).  That's $1164.99(or $1249.99 if cracked).

Right now there's also a promotion for $300 off, making it $999.99.  Keep in mind that you can't do a trade in and this promotion though.

Of course this is all for just the base price of the phone and the coverage/care plans are a whole other fiasco.

Good luck! Also if you're a teacher or student or military(there might've been a few more people covered in this so look into it) you can get up to a 30% discount."
"You just saying you can‚Äôt afford paying for the phone upfront, so you need to take a loan in form of a phone contract"
"NEVER had a dropped call or lost service is 16 months with US mobile, using their ATT or Tmobile towers"
I guess so. It's not for everyone. Depending on your lifestyle. For me. A regular phone can't cut it for me. Especially when I'm on the go. But I don't ever see it dropping below 1500. Especially when the S25U is around 1k or so. It might have been worse if Apple had a foldable. Price wise I mean.
[deleted]
it's exponential
"The most limiting part is finding a hard and scratch resistant material that bends and is transparent. Material science won't be able to advance that far, compared to other technologies like 3d printing, 5g, and AI. All those technologies rely on pre existing technologies and knowledge. Material science is all trial and error, the cutting edge materials also take decades to materialize in consumer markets and have the capability to be mass manufacturable."
I‚Äôm originally from Boston and have never acclimated to the hot and humid but I work inside the A/C. I‚Äôd rather be in 0¬∞ than 100¬∞ but most of my family now is in Florida so I sweat out the summers.
Only Distilled Water only and wet the Microfiber Cloth with it and wipe then use a Dry Microfiber Cloth to dry it.
"¬†Your story is just not believable. The materials in a Galaxy Fold cannot survive the extreme heat, dust, and chemical exposure you‚Äôre claiming. Plastic OLED layers, adhesives, and the UTG screen would have warped, melted, or fused long before now. Without concrete proof, this is either a massive exaggeration or straight up fabrication. You can‚Äôt cheat material science, no amount of ‚Äúcleaning with water‚Äù is going to make your phone magically indestructible."
"You are correct!!! They've actually come down in price when I googled to make sure I had the correct model which was a pleasant surprise.

I'd also had a rough set of months when I looked originally too. Had to fix my hvac, got in a wreck, and a plumbing issue. (Around 2500 total). I also took a new job knowing it was a pretty decent pay cut. 

It's looking better now, that pay cut job sucked (as I knew) but gave me the freedom to get another (smaller cut) job. The 2nd job gave me a raise and now I'm making more than my original and in a better position, cheaper and better insurance, closer to home by far etc. I've been building back up."
"why does it matter how I got the phone, keep hating"
"And with that you get no credit for past phone purchases.  I don't know, what is your point here?  I have an amazing phone that I love and pay 70 a month.  ü§∑"
"my last 2 samsung devices, phone and tablet had battery blowing out of the case issues, so I am not a samsung fan any more

agree, that once Crapple **""invents""** a foldable phone, the prices will probably rise for them"
">There is not a material on the planet that has these properties or can come close.

That's literally why chemistry and science exist 

>Clear, flexible, super strong

>way more expensive than $2k

We not talking about diamond or something, we juts need something like gorilla glass with flexibility"
"Maybe my jeans do enough shielding to prevent extreme damage.  It's not like the phone is directly exposed to the heat, and a decent amount of material does get into my pocket.

I was literally inside of a steel furnace like 3 weeks ago.  Melted my boots and caught a pallet on fire that was holding our bricks. We had to renew the bricks and other materials that line a steel furnace.  We can't stay inside longer than 15-20 minutes and must get out to cool down and drink obscene amounts of water. That furnace had only cooled for a total of maybe 6 hours after dumping out the last of the steel inside.

Im not claiming my phone is indestructible, my cover screen can attest to that.  I am just saying they are stronger than people think and it takes more than people claim to have issues with the hinge, inner screen, and other functions.

Believe what you want.  I live it almost every day and know what this thing is put through.  I didn't think I could trust a foldable.  But I make enough money doing what I do to take the risk on an expensive phone.  When this one inevitably dies, I will get a new one again.  These things are stupid tough.

I have NOTHING to gain by making stuff up and lying."
"I'm assuming your old job was miserable(?) if so that's wonderful to hear that you got a new job despite the pay cut :)

It seems like things have been starting to go well for you so good job! Hopefully you'll be able to treat yourself soon, even if it isn't the s25 lol."
It doesn‚Äôt matter and I don‚Äôt care about your phone. I was just referring to your post before. You said: that someone else ‚Äûis mad because he can‚Äôt afford the phone‚Äú. Where in fact it‚Äôs you who can‚Äôt afford it so you get it with a loan.
I feel you. Sucks that happened tho with your last 2 phones. After the Note 7 battery issues. I was pissed. But they got it together from since then. Battery wise. I think that's why they scared to put a bigger battery in the Folds. Idk üòÇ
That guy is wrong
Welcome to the club!
"The S24 is really the peak design!
No stupid camera bezels and flat edges! Looks absolutely slick and powerful"
Use Registar. May help sort things a bit.
Try out one hand operation. This is literally the only reason why I don't want to leave this device
Congrats welcome to the club üëèüèøI like everything about my S24+ it's perfect for me even though I'm still learning more of the features each day I've always been a Samsung userüíØ
"So I switched over from iPhone 16 pro to the S25. I needed a phone which covered what I needed rather than the same thing everyone else had

Things I love:
 -one hand operations mode, I have one of the actions to bring up a quick menu which has all the mains apps I use on a daily basis

- sound assistance, I'm a nerd i like listening to audio books and having some music play silently behind it, sound assistance easily allows me to do that.

- Samsung Dex, if I'm being lazy and cba to get my laptop I plug in my phone and whip out notes and my lecture videos side by side.

- split screen has been helpful in some occasions, unsure if that's just a samsung feature or android.

Cons
- Camera is wack but don't take enough pictures to care
- hate the fact there is no express travel like on iphones so have to unlock my phone to pay for contactless travel
- iPhone App integration for certain apps I have to make payments to is way better than on samsumg mostly due to the fact that Apple Pay is integrated into these apps whereas there's no Google pay or Samsung pay for them"
"Here are a few posts that helped me when I switched to an S24+ from iPhone

Goodlock-basically you can do almost anything with it.
Get Good Lock for more customization.
I did the opposite (from S23) and I miss the global back gesture and the keyboard! Oh the keyboard on Android are SO MUCH BETTER. You are gonna love it.
"Litterally, use the Search feature to find anything on the phone and it will take you to it."
"Screenshot..

You can do extended Screenshots over 20x the length of your screen..

Sometimes it gets ridiculous,  but it's great for screenshoting conversations and receipts, etc.."
"If you want to view your notifications in detailed manner (without touching the notifications icons), well when you change the lockscreen wallpaper of your phone, there are edges surrounded by the icons which will be seen on lock screen. Just touch those icons and you will get options like Icons only, Detailed etc. Choose detailed if you want to otherwise you are good to go!!! 

There's not so much functionality about the same in settings.

PS: Other samsung phone(new ones) follow this method so I think yours will too"
"So this is coming from another S24+ user, and i also switched from OnePlus in the fall of 2024 so i do have some experience. But i would definitely use the apps inside of GoodLock this will help you so much in terms of customization, and shortcuts. 

And if you are willing to pay, i would suggest OneGlass which is an app inside of the Play store which has iPhone like glass icons"
i have the same phone and coming from a iphone xr was like. a breath of fresh air. i love it
"I always loved those over the plus and ultra,
Unfortunately Samsung doesn‚Äôt treat it like a flagship anymore."
"Use goodlock, thats the only app i recommend, you can use it to customize pretty much everything in your phone
Plus its by samsung"
"i got an s21plus back then and the exynos chip was complete ass the phone heated so much in summer that i put it in the fridge. i also only had 128gbs of storage and for some reason system storage was 88gb other. 

just my experience."
"What you should know firsthand is that whichever phone you decide to use, you'll get used to it in a while (unless you become desperate and sell the thing off).


Now coming to Samsung phones, nowadays their main selling point has become a mix of their hardware (which is very mature and saturated enough to only get minor incremental upgrades) and software (their own Android skin One UI which is pretty decent which it's own unique features, and their excellent Samsung AI, which is quite ahead of other competition).

You can use your phone in two ways: 
1. Setting up basic Google account (or whichever account you use) and start using the phone with it's basic features.
2. Explore all various features that are One UI exclusive and adjust to them as per your liking."
I recently switched to the OnePlus 13 after my S23's screen died twice and started being super laggy. So glad I switched to OnePlus
"One UI will become second nature to you!  You'll be using it like you were born with it soon enough. Even during big updates like 5 to 6 and 6 to 7. We all had to learn and get used to the changes. So we all understand, lol.youll love it!!!"
"Nice choice of phone. I use the same one but in purple color. I mainly use Good Lock to customize everything and it took me forever to customize it lol. I am annoyed at the fact that I can't swipe reply or react (I mean I send emoji reactions on G Messages but I use the Samsung version), as I used to do both all the time on my iPhone. Samsung Pass is basically like Google Password Manager but it helps you much more. Congrats on the phone."
That‚Äôs a good looking phone.
Yep one ui is a little messy at beggining but one ui 7 is better and in settimgs there are rly good searchbar
"Past phone - moto g9
Few days back got  - samsung s24 FE 

I bought the moto phone as motorola was one of the oldest company to bring cell phones, so I trusted them and honestly it worked great.

2 days using samsung, not sure what to say but haven't found any big flaws."
"It is good 
Just enjoy"
Solid device in a small package. You won‚Äôt regret it.
"Top camera, top screen image, top battery life, top charging, top interface, top apps, top most essential features!"
"Eden for switch, winlator for pc games."
"I have the same issue with my s25. Very fiddly and difficult to find simple things wrapped up in the leviathan settings. If you don't know their samsung-y name, you can't find them without googling it first. Over the years they seem to have developed the big ball of mud approach to the interface"
If you can't find things on it then move them to where you can find them.  I loved my S24
"The selected mobile device is an excellent choice. I also utilize this model, albeit in a purple finish. My primary method of customization involves Good Lock, which required a significant time investment to configure to my preferences. I find the absence of swipe-to-reply and reaction functionalities, which I previously utilized on my iPhone, to be somewhat inconvenient. Samsung Pass offers similar functionality to Google Password Manager, with enhanced features. Congratulations on your new device."
"Samsung will probably make you the last , with there customer service üôÇ and phone issues. From a s23 user who had line issues , Note:  was a samsung loverü•≤"
"One of the thing about Samsung settings is that most of the useful features are hidden in plain sight. Because, what do you mean I have to click ‚ÄúNow Bar‚Äù in settings and it opens up a whole new menu to enable/disable curtain apps live notifications?

Thankfully, it only requires exploration and familiarization to know what, where, and how everything works with OneUI and its extensive list of settings. And this has yet to touch many customization possibilities.

I come from Sony ecosystem for almost seven years; Xperia 1 to replace my S10 5G, then Xperia 1 III, before switching to S24+. Many of the QoL apps, settings, and especially Modes & Routines are more than welcome.

As for the reason why I chose S24+ was that it's easy to get, and I'm captivated by the 6 years of updates Samsung had promised. I've never had a phone that promised such longevity‚Äîaside from Apple iPhone XR, then 13 Pro but these are work phones and not my daily driver‚Äîand a very clean UI, well, say no more. It has strong contender: Xiaomi 14 and Vivo X200 Pro. But after much deliberations (I've spent a week testing these three smartphones) I close the chapter with the S24+.

And despite my small hands, I'm loving this 6.7‚Äù screen.

It looks like an iPhone lol

"i use A14,and i want to get a special  experience. my friends suggest S24 ultra, so i want to ask if are there any issues with S24 ultra."
Try goodlock from the Samsung storeif you care about customisation (oh my lord they have a lot of customisation maybe a bit too much lol)
"Me too, I'm typing this on a Samsung Galaxy A34 after switching from Moto Edge 40 Neo, liking it thus far!"
[removed]
"Drawing from my experience as a fellow S24+ user, having also transitioned from OnePlus in the fall of 2024, I recommend leveraging the applications available within Good Lock to significantly enhance customization and shortcut functionalities.

Furthermore, for those seeking a paid option, I suggest exploring OneGlass, an application available on the Play Store, which offers iPhone-style glass icons."
"Hi. I'm having the exact same problem. I just bought a Galaxy S24 Ultra and although it looks awesome, I feel like I'm absolutely lost with it. I've been looking online to try and figure out even the most basic features (basic for me, I guess). I'd love some advice, tips, hacks, etc. Or maybe some videos, websites, etc. 
I've only ever used LG phones and there definitely wasn't any kind of a ""learning curve"" associated with any of their phones. I totally get that the S24 Ultra is FAR more advanced, but it would be amazing to be able to understand how to do more with my new phone than turn it on. ü§™LoL!  Thank you!"
"You need Good Lock. Most stock features are great but if you really want to unlock the potential of Samsung, download this. I don't really use it myself but I do have a look from time to time."
How is the battery life? and how much time does it take to change?
"# Getting 3 dots when on call screen (blinks once) what to do? New M56

https://preview.redd.it/mb7sfx9bjzif1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11f364fa368d102e092e8a81ca351e9bb5772b32

Guys, a little worried about those green dots? Got this phone recently. Is it something serious? Appears only on call, blinks once. When I switch on the speakers, it doesn't appear. No issues on any other part. People on reddit and samsung community say its a proximity sensor, but is it true? Should I be worried?"
Le meilleur chez Android !
"Same here and very disappointed with some settings. Good thing I didn't buy a so called premium one. Is this possible that in 2025 to not have the possibility in settings for net speed and clock seconds to  show in notifications bar (when almost all the other phone companies have it by default). 
Same issues on Pixel phones. Ridiculous??????????"
[deleted]
"absolutely!

the design caught me at first glance when I was looking for the options in the market, although the price was higher than I was planning, but putting everything on the balance, it became my favorite and I had to make this investment."
Look how (almost) flat those camera are! I bet you could send a text from a table with minimal rockage!
"I agree, the whole s24 lineup, the s24 ultra is probably the best looking ultra, after the s22 of 0"
thanks for the advice!
BRO WHAT I did not know that was a thing that's nuts
"Are you using google pay or samsung pay?

It's called transport card. Once you select, you won't need to unlock phone to touch on barrier.
*"
"S25 or S25 Ultra?

The camera itself on the Ultra is better than the iPhone camera. I think you're just used to the image processing on iPhone, which is admittedly more eye-catching to the general public. Or you just went for the S25, which doesn't have as nice of a camera as the iPhone 16 Pro.

Which apps have Apple Pay, but not Google Pay? I haven't run into this issue."
"Split screen and picture-in-picture are Android features, but each brand/launcher may have slightly different ways to open the apps in parallel"
I also would very much like to play music behind my audio books. Can you please explain how you did it? I searched for sound assistance in settings but didn't find a match (I use S25+) üôè
"congrats for the new phone!
very nice device, isn't it?

I wanted to buy with this color, but couldn't find anywhere :/
so I bought the marble gray one, and its kinda nice though"
"What are you talking about? Motorola phones and Samsung both run Android OS, both have customizable keyboard and global back gestures üòÇ"
Motorola is an android too wdym better keyboard? ü§£
Where is it located on samsung? Im an apple user and i just swipe up on the screen and it appears but im scared if i switch i wont have that anymore. It also shows me my most used apps at the same time
"we used to have this on hello UI aswell, it's an excellent feature, definitely helps a lot on a few things"
"that's actually amazing as another new person, I have thousands of screenshots and am always struggling to line them up in the best way"
"thanks for this answer! I'm still trying to get used with the notifications part, I'm gonna take a look"
"thanks for the answer buddy!

gonna take a look on it, I didn't have much free time to explore the customization part yet, but I'm gonna search it up"
"I've never used an iPhone, it seems to have a smooth interface as well but I have a problem with their storage and ram memory.

my girlfriend still has the iphone 11, she bought like 4y ago and paid like 4000$ (on our currency here in brazil) for a 64gb storage phone.

this is a big no for me, but it is a nice phone with a good camera, it works well till today, thats the main problem for me"
"But still its a very good phone for most of the users, and the camera is not bad either
Enjoy it üòç"
"my girlfriend's nephew had an s21 but I don't recall the model exactly, one time I was with him and he was playing a game and finished the match, put the phone on the table normally and when he picked up again the phone had a green line on the screen.

and it seems to be a problematic model apparently, hope that it doesn't happen with other phones.

the s24+ at least here in brazil in only with exynos chip, he's been heating a little bit and the battery is kinda okay, but I think it should last longer for a new phone, but let me see how it goes on the next months"
"I'm the opposite of that, I've bought an expensive phone with years of guaranteed updates because I don't wanna change it too soon hahaha

I've just set up the basics but I'm curious so wanna explore more of it, just got the phone on friday so I'm discovering a lot of nice features"
"OnePlus is an incredible phone, I've seen a review from it but unfortunately its hard to find here in brazil and import it from other country may be too expensive, we have a lot of taxes :/

what do you like the most on it?"
"Yeah, it does! but it's a beautiful device with a simple design and a good camera layout.

There are a lot of good phones out there, but they're kind of ugly, and I'm a little futile about it, the look counts hahaha so the S24+ caught me."
"yeah omg it does

this was the first thing I gave it a look after I made this post and there's a looooot of things, I've ended up not changing anything hahahah"
"how was your experience with Motorola edge? I was inclined to buy the 40 or 50 pro, but I found this one and had to choose him"
"this one is marble gray, is a nice color even tho I wish I had bought the black one

and the amber yellow is a pretty decent color, is not that strong, to me it ressambles an iphone that there's a gold version, is kinda light and pale, very discreet. 

If that's what you looking for, you should buy it, its a great phone!"
"It is great, on my first days of intense usage with games I've felt that the battery didn't last long as it should, but my previous phone had 5000mph so maybe I was used to it, but on a daily basis with an average usage the battery is okay I can go through the day with it.

It charges fast on its own charger, for about an hour it gets a 100%

The only thing I really dislike about this phone is that the last 5% of battery don't last at ALL, a few days ago it hit 1% and I went to another room to get the charger and when I came back, the phone was off, so I can't count with him in a emergency"

Welcome
"You will get used to it at the end of the day.


I found it confusing using pixels after Samsung, for example.¬†"
"Using Google pay, unsure if I was being a Bozo but kept on having issues with Samsung Pay, might have been my phone case but when I tapped it on the contactless machine sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't and it was doing my head in"
"Base S25, for me it's mainly the parking apps. Apcoa has Apple pay integrated and for android you need to remember your CVC and authenticate payment through the bank.
Think I had the same issue with RingGo aswell but the Apcoa one does my head in since I use it almost daily"
"On sound assistance scroll all the way down until you see ""Multi sound"" enable it and then select the Apps you want to use multi sound for. You could select all or just select the Apps you will be using multi sound for.

There's still something I'm missing which is how to control the volume of the 2 apps without having to go back into sound assistance every time. Hopefully someone whose used it can help fill the gap on how that's done"
"Swipe up or down within the screen area, not from the edges or conners (they have different behavior if you swipe from a different angle), you'll get the Search option."
Yes just keep this in mind or you have to scroll my reply again lol
"I think you've already come across it but Modes and Routines is one of the most unique features of One UI, also try GoodLock for interface customization."
I don't blame you. Definitely not a bad design
Just curious as you're somewhat new to Samsung what's something that struck out the most for u?
"In general it's a bang for buck phone, I don't like the software (after android 15 at least), it went from bone stock android to yet another Xiaomi clone, the hardware is great though."
"Ah, I see."
You can turn that option off for the CVC. I just leave it on in case but there's a way to turn it off because I used to have it off on my phone but I can't remember because now I've been using Samsung pay more
"As I stated I was having problems with my last phone, it didn't had updates in like 2 years so there a lot of performance issues at this point.

I was looking for phone with a good performance that I could keep for a while since I'm not a person that change devices every year, and I found this guy and not gonna lie, its design got me, it's a very good looking phone with a high quality finish, and the moment I saw it, I knew I had to pick this one hahaha was love at first sight

I'm gonna be honest and say I didn't had a very good impression about Samsung because the issues they had years ago about battery and stuff like that so I never think about of getting a device from them, but I do regret this, I'm having a good time now with the s24+

but def what struck me the most was the performance, its awesome, its a device with 12gb ram so I can do pretty much everything, can use a lot of apps at the same time with 0 problems and 0 crash outs, and its nice that I can modify a lot of things in it, there's a high quantity of features, a nice display of cameras, as a flagship device should be, I'm loving the experience so far"
"Yes!

The current samsung phones are rated for double the charge cycles compared to other phones, so battery durability is excellent, just make sure to not get it too hot.

And physical durability is no slough either, even without a case I've dropped the phone multiple times, only slight scratches"
"Been a Samsung user for 15 years since Galaxy Y. Now i'm currently using A56. None of my devices I've used been into a major issue, just minor ones. But still holds up even if your phone stops providing updates.

I only saw a lot of people using Samsung Care if they bought foldable phone rather than the S lineup particularly because of the display panel. But nothing would go wrong if you take care of it properly just like how you took care of your Poco F3."
"Ive used the samsung note phones for last 10 years or so and they were extremely durable. Got the s22 ultra since the notes are no longer a thing and broke within the first month of having it, thats with a case and screen protector. Also more ad card slot im not very happy id say durability is not great at all, atleast compared to the notes ive had."
"Had a Note 10+ for almost 7 years,the on/off button fell off,the pen losts its connection,the back of it broke and lost its glue that I was able to open it like a book,the glass from the camera also lost its glue and fell off and one time it fell from my pocket and landed on a toilet at a funeral and its screen blacked out but after 3 days the screen turned back on and it worked like it didn't happened so...yeah Samsung is waaaaay more durable, Lmao."
"I use an Otterbox Commuter on my S23, know it can survive drops on concrete. 

My bare S23 did slide off a table, onto a hardwood floor. Didn't even leave a mark. Tile floor would have been a different story."
"My Samsung Galaxy S8+ from 2017 works as a WiFi device as good as ever. It is no longer supported. The battery charges up to 100% and needs recharging every other day. If the battery fails, I will recycle at the e-waste center.  The A03 batter swelled up in a few weeks, I am  guessing from being plugged in 24/7 and having too much running  in the background. Samsung‚Äôs biggest problem to me is the automatic screen time out is only ten minutes, way too short!"
Samsung is the only brand I've owned that seems to last. Maybe it's bad luck but I've always come crawling back. One plus was the worst for me though with a dead phone just 13 months in and happened to die like 2 days before the s21u pre-orders and I ran that phone for almost 5 years and it still works great but just upgraded for better performance and because I wanted to try a foldable.
"I was a passenger holding my phone chatting, when the motorcycle i was riding got in an accident. No case or tempered glass. I was injured more than the phone. It ended up with very minor scratches you can barely see."
"I dropped my phone screen down on the corner of a piece of gym equipment and cracked the screen. I have Samsung Care so the repair was $29. Seems like out of pocket cost for a screen would've been around $700 so Care+ paid for itself nearly 2x with one drop. They're durable phones for sure, but insurance is great when you need it."
I used the old s7 edge for 7 years instead of the 5 they advertised. i'm still using it today as my media player paired with fiio e17K.
"Been using samsung phones 10 years, they all still work. The only time they have been damaged is 100% user error with the exception of an a23 that had charging issues after less than a year. I work in a factory so they see more stress than most phones out there."
"Based on personal experience, Samsung devices have demonstrated a superior lifespan compared to other brands. While individual experiences may vary, previous encounters with alternative brands, such as OnePlus, resulted in premature device failure. Specifically, a OnePlus device experienced complete failure within 13 months of ownership. Conversely, a Samsung device, the S20 Ultra, provided nearly five years of reliable service before being upgraded for enhanced performance and to explore foldable technology."
"I've been using my A51 for 5 years now its my first phone so you can imagine how much I dropped it, I just have a small scratch on the front."
[deleted]
ohh! Good to know! Thank you for confirming about the durability\~
"The s25 has a charge cycle rating of 2000, the iphone 16 pro max has just a 1000 rating. I think he compared it to the iphone."
"Samsung was compared to pixel and iphone.  Not xiaomi, samsung could have half the charges, the same, or less, we dont know"
Wow that's so bad for such an expensive iPhone.
"What's the point of a good Xiaomi battery of the rest of the phone is designed with planned obsolescence in mind?


My two Xiaomis both died conveniently just after they got out of warranty. ""Motherboard"" issues... sure."
"Well yes, from what I have seen modern iphones batteries degrade faster"
It was pointed out in EVERY YouTube video...
theyre most likely killing off the S pen to save 4 cents
"Honestly, the Fold7 is my first folding phone, coming from the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra. I've never used the pen on either -- sure once in a while I take it out to try to use it more but truthfully I just never found a use case for me. 


So yeah the Fold 7 caters really well to me, as someone who wants the tablet experience sitting down while a convincing slab form phone while walking around. 


I totally get that a lot of people like the S Pen and use it constantly, but that simply isn't me."
"There's a lot of things that can be said about the S Pen removal, but ""swept under the rug"" isn't one of them. 

I wasn't even actively researching it and every tech site headline in my news app was about it and every  featured video on YouTube that mentioned the phone mentioned the removal of the s pen"
I suspect you knew all of this and you just want to continue to rant. Nothing was swept under the rug. People who wanted S pen support are skipping this device and those who don't care are buying it. Both groups have moved on.
"I've never stuck with a fold because of the stupid front screen ratio. It was always too skinny and too tall. And then they come out with the 7 and it's better by a lot. Not perfect, but better. And then I find out they cheaped out on battery and charging again, and ditched the pen? No thanks, I'll stick with my iPhone for another year or two until Samsung gets it right."
"So you're saying you bought it without even going into a store to try it out and not ask questions? Surely this would be the FIRST thing you would notice or inquire about as this is a main reason or the only reason for you to upgrade

2k to pay for a feature which is a make or break for you is quite a critical flaw in your rant"
It's an absolute shame. I really hope another company moves in with pen support on their non-tablets at some point.
Dang someone didnt do their homework before ordering a $2k phone lmao
Lack of bluetooth facilities on S25 ultra‚Äôs S pen  is annoying.
"I literally never used the pen on both the Ultra and the fold i owned even if i though it was a must have.

Sadly i think the pen is gone forever, even for the Ultras."
"I understand your frustration. As an avid pen user on my tablet and ultra, I too was disappointed. 

I look forward to its return in the future (hopefully integrated as well). However this is my first fold and I am in love. I have moved to type notes on my mobile but still use pen on my tab. 

This phone has been amazing. The durability and thin portable design has been a game changer. It has made multitasking for work on the go so much easier. Comics, reading, multitasking, or sharing content like pictures and videos with others has been amazing. 

2 iphone users actually just switched after using mine and seeing how helpful it is for them with multitasking. 

If you have a fold it may make sense to keep the one you have, but if you value the extra portability and larger displays it may still be worth it (if you can live without a pen on the go)."
Honestly never used the s-pen on my folds....bought one but rarely used it.
I want a big screen and the pen. I'm a long time ultra user who was planning to switch over to fold when I saw how much slimmer the 7 was. Once I found out it wasn't going to have the pen I decided I'm going to stick with the ultra line. If they ever get rid of the pen on the ultra I'll leave Samsung entirely.
I have the honor v5. Glad i went that way. Battery life is a bit ridiculous how good it is.  Im waiting on my pen still though.
"u/Naylaaaaa Completely agree with the SPen thing. I am just afraid they might totally remove it from the Ultra series too! S25 removed Bluetooth support from the SPen :(

FYI the **Oneplus Open actually supports a stylus**! Its just not mentioned in most Youtube Videos because the Stylus is not avialable in American markets, but there are some Redditors / Youtubers who have imported it. Also it supports a stylus **on the front screen as well**!"
"Agreed. From leaked renders of the Tab S11 line, it seems like even it is losing support for Bluetooth/Air Actions while retaining the S Pen"
"The android software is finger touched based, copied from Apple & you don‚Äôt realize who is this for?

Pen was an add-on for the ‚Äúfinger touched‚Äù interface."
While the marketing didn't make it abundantly clear that it would no longer be available they also never marketed it saying it would and a lot of media was reporting it and udc being two missing features and you really should do a basic level of research on such an expensive purchase.
Didn't know this until now. Won't buy any folds now that that feature is gone. Literally the only value I had toward that big screen. As I dont play games
I didn't do my research for 400 Alex
Ok
You have thumbs
I'm surprised you missed that it was plastered everywhere about the complaints. I'm with you on being upset that it's removed. I actually skipped the phone altogether because of this. I was able to find a brand new fold5  still in box that I got. I'll wait around until the fold 8 or 9 and if they haven't brought it back I'll just get a used Samsung tablet that has s pen support and I can get over the loss of having UDC as well at that point but I'm holding out hope that they'll bring these missing features back. If you look back at all the generations of the folds you'll see so many features removed that actually were pretty great Not sure why they do this  in the search of being the thinnest phone for all but a day until the next company gets a thinner one lol
"Only Samsung use Wacom technology in phones.  All other devices uses an active pen powered by the battery. So if u need an spen, your buy any phone prior to the zfold7"
"Yeah, it's a shame. A phone that has the most potential for the s-pen is not s-pen compatible¬†"
"Its too thin and they announced that allready, maybe in the z8 they will figure out a slimmer pen but thats a stretch even for Samsung."
"You can order the fold 6 special edition from Korea, basically had everything the fold 7 does ph but also no spen shit ur stuck"
[removed]
"It'll be back.. Their¬†1-2% S-Pen usage data is just damage control marketing BS. Watch Samsung, in their typical hypocritical fashion first make fun of, and then pivot a 180 once Apple releases their foldable with pencil support.¬†"
Welp...I'll be honest I was totally going to upgrade but no SPen actually makes a huge difference to me. I love it and use it as lot. Massively disappointing. Thanks for your post OP.
"I acknowledge your sentiments regarding the absence of the pen functionality. As a user of both tablet and ultra devices, I share your disappointment.

I anticipate the future integration of this feature. However, as a first-time Fold user, I am impressed. I have adapted to typing notes on my mobile device while continuing to utilize the pen on my tablet.

This phone has exceeded expectations. The durable and portable design has significantly enhanced my workflow. It has streamlined on-the-go multitasking. The experience of consuming content, such as comics, reading materials, and multimedia, has been exceptional.

Two iPhone users have transitioned to this device after experiencing its multitasking capabilities.

If you currently possess a Fold device, retaining it may be prudent. If portability and larger displays are prioritized, it may still be a worthwhile investment, provided the absence of on-the-go pen functionality is acceptable."
Fold 7 will work with a stylus.
"I think s-pen whiners are funny as shit, and I wonder why the F they didn't buy a tablet for that in the first place?

![gif](giphy|13l7w7N4Vr1dw4)"
Buy a Chinese phone if you really need it.
I shouldn't have to watch third party videos to discover a core feature would be removed 7 models deep.
"It's not the cents, it's probably the fraction of s millimeter in bulk, they save"
I'm pretty sure they're working on a new tech for spen. Wonder how it'll work for the utras
"I'm glad you enjoy yours.  
I understand that many people might not need to use it constantly if they're not in a creative field or not a manual note writer but even for people like yourself, it's still a feature that is better to have and not need, than not have at all.

(That's my opinion, anyway)"
"I get that you don't use it, which is fine, but it should still be there for anyone else because those are the only phones that still have support after killing the note line."
"What are you even on about? I stopped ranting days ago, I made this post, returned my phone and moved on with my life. The thread keeps getting revived from people finding it."
"Yep.  I had the Fold 3.  I switched to Honor Magic V2, because the Fold 3 front screen was pretty much unusable.   The larger screen, has me back to Samsung."
"I'm tempted to try the Google Pixel Fold tbh, but I need to do some research on it"
"I get to switch phone very 30 days for free as part of my contract. If I was physically parting with a full ¬£2000 I would've given it more thought. No harm was done, the phone has been sent back, I learned a lesson to double check next time I take advantage of the phone swapping feature of my contract.

It just really sucks that they removed the feature, that's all"
"The Z Fold 6 was exceptional, I wish we could've had the quality of life features of the 6 and 7 merged into one but it obviously wasn't meant to be.

I'm a tattoo artist and the Fold was the perfect phone that allowed me to work on the go, with the S Pen seriously being as good as and sometimes even better than the Apple Pencil.

trust me, multitasking was \*even nicer\* with a functional pen. I'm very glad you're enjoying your new phone though, foldables are really damn cool."
not really sure why anyone would want the liability that comes with a foldable if not to use the S Pen?
"the Z Fold 6 is excellent, I'd still highly recommend that if you'd like a foldable."
"I can switch phone as often as I like for free, if I was splashing ¬£2000 cold hard cash perhaps I would've checked that the 7 still has S Pen support. Either way, the mistake was made, learned my lesson. When the 8 comes out I will definitely be checking whether they are bringing back the S Pen or not. It is what it is."
"so many people shitting on me for this post/not knowing but there have been a couple of people like yourself that didn't know until reading this, so I'm glad I didn't delete it.

Hopefully they'll bring it back! If not, perhaps their competitors might be worth giving a shot?"
"I had just been autopiloting my upgrades because I have o2 Switch Up and every Z Fold generation upgrade had made me happy thus far, so I got complacent. Definitely learned a lesson, but at least no harm was done.  
  
Yeah I don't understand the fascination with being the most thin either, it makes the 7 ridiculously lopsided because of the huge cameras so it doesn't even ""feel"" thin anyway. Nice that you got a 5! I loved my 5 when I had it. I'm currently on the 6 and it's genuinely really good, I was just excited for an increase in performance but the 6 is still more than capable at what I use it for."
"Why even offer a foldable if not for the inner digitiser screen? At that point, buy a tablet, no??"
"I really hope so.
Until then I'll either stay on my Z Fold 6 or perhaps try a competitor out, who knows!

I would love to see an Apple foldable. My biggest question on that front is what the hell is taking them so long? I feel like they'd have joined the foldable market by now if they ever intended to. But perhaps they are waiting for the right tech/right time??"
"Glad I could be of help! Here's hoping the next gen brings the pen back, it's so disappointing"
https://youtu.be/GLFziNYk9Qc
That's not a good answer if they live in the US.
Such as? Which chinese fold supports an active stylus?
That's on you then if you refuse to do any research or gather information before spending 2k.
You didn't watch Samsung's own marketing material when the phones were announced?
Who spends 2k on a phone without doing ANY research.
The first fold dad a spen?
You spend $2000 on something you don't do a modicum of research on? Just a single review read/watched would have told you this.
"A phone company will never say, ""hey we DON'T have compatibility for certain features on this phone"".  
it does not make sense why you would expect it."
"It's more than cents and that is why they do it, IMHO. The fractions of a mm excuse they give makes no sense. Now they have sold a record number of folds this launch and it will solidify their choice. It's very simple, if people don't require it for purchase, they won't include it. Same thing happened with charging blocks, honestly."
"that doesn't mean they should remove it for an entire generation in the meantime to give us it back again as if they're our saviour, it's so strange"
[deleted]
"Oh for sure, I respect that. Especially if you're a creative or if you take a lot of handwritten notes, I can definitely see how the pen is an instrumental feature. Heck if you asked me back when I was in college, my answer might be very different than now!

  
Even though I never used my S Pen on my S24U/S25U, I am still glad it existed. Maybe one day Samsung can offer an alternative Fold that has S Pen support!"
"If that was the case, why even reply? You didn't have to.

Something inauthentic about you."
"If you are in-between, might as well wait until August 20th for the Pixel Event when the Pixel 10 Pro Fold gets announced."
"Glad you were able to switch the phone and your contract allows you to do that

There's quite a choice of foldable out there now, there's the Google 9 fold, the honour V3, the one plus open, Oppo N5. All these phones come with different OS of course, but probs not going to be a steep learning curve but that it's still Android 

It does seem a dumb move considering how perfect it would be for it"
"There's plenty of reasons to get a foldable without having to use the spen! It does suck they dropped it for those who do use it but it may not all be over:

Samsung 'will reconsider' an S Pen return after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 snubbed it | Android Central https://share.google/1FvWycaJKOzQz3Arm"
"There's no liability; these things are durable. I don't know what you guys are doing. Maybe just be more careful. And yeah, I never used an S Pen on it; I just used my tablet if I needed to write. The fold is too small for writing, in my opinion."
Fair enough
"They wouldn't remove it if they didn't have data showing the small usage. It's probably in the 1-2% of users id imagine.

I've had a fold since the 4, never used an s pen. Foldables aren't for the digitizer screen..."
"Apple, usually, takes a wait and watch approach with their core products ( iPhone being their primary bread and butter ). I don't see it as having taken too long because the foldable tech ( mostly the construction of the hinges, inner glass/plastic flex, iP ratings etc ) is just starting to pickup. The Fold 6 was where the foldables started ( imo ) to become generally durable, with the Fold 7 building on that quite a bit. Now, I believe, Apple sees this as time to strike (just as they did going larger with the iPhones 6 series )¬†

I wish there were more competition besides Apple, Samsung, and Google to keep these on their toes and benefit us, the end users, in terms of price, features et al.

Oh well, better late than never üòä"
Totally agree with you 10000%...I wonder if they're gonna take them away from the ultras now to?
Not a great sell when he has to tap twice almost every time he wants to select something.
Well yeah cause us market is restricted af. You could import the phone if customer service is not something you care about.
Oneplus open and some others
"Honor V5 apparently. Not sure if it's available in the US, but decided to try one of their tablets before deciding if to switch next year or hold out till Samsung brings back the spen"
"Considering that Samsung announced the lack of S Pen support in advance, I think the poster was just lazy."
"I'm on o2 Switch Up, I didn't have to spend 2k. I get to hand the Z Fold 7 back and keep my Z Fold 6.

Thought this was a pretty common feature of phone contracts these days?

Either way, no harm done. I'm not out any money. I just think removing the S Pen was a poor choice by Samsung, it is what it is."
"This feels bad faith. I bought the z fold 3-5 and never had to watch YouTube videos lol. After the 3, 4, 5 i did however use YouTube to determine im not getting the 6 because the phone was barely improving"
"The Samsung promotional videos I saw did not overly market ""this phone no longer has S Pen functionality"", unsurprisingly.

Why would they market what their phone does NOT have??"
I get to switch phone for free every 30 days because of the way my contract works.
"Oh, you mean like how they did away with removable batteries?    Way more people took advantage of that feature, than the number of people who use the Spen often enough to care it is gone.  In fact, there are a lot of things that are gone, that were more important to me than Spen.  Headphone jack.  IR blaster.  SD card."
I'm still missing the IR blaster.
Well originally it was for more business focused people. Being able to sign PDFs and other documents with a hand written signature on to go is honestly great.
"because you criticised me and I'm rightfully defending myself? Why are you trying to psychoanalyse me because of my disappointment over a phone, weirdo"
"That's good to hear, thank you for letting me know!"
And then there's android authority saying Samsung is gearing up to get rid of it whether you like it or not
"there's a lot of useful features in a lot of tech that don't get removed tho, simply because it's better to have than not have, you know?

We're supposed to be upgrading after each release, not downgrading.   
I guess that's ultimately what I'm getting at. It's not like the phone magically got cheaper as an end result of removing the tablet tech, the only justification I've seen is that the screens are thinner because of it. The form factor of the Z Fold 6 was already great, so I don't think the trade-off was worth it.

Again, that's just my opinion tho. I understand that people will disagree!"
"If you say they have data, then show the data"
Just letting op know the option is there.
How could you not know? It was reported everywhere.
"The price is irrelevant, you should gather information on any purchase. Again, that's on you..."
I don't know if you've switched up before but you cannot get that contract back as its already paid off and completed. You can open a new contract for fold 6 but that would be money wasted
That makes it somehow worse. Why upgrade if you don't even know what you are upgrading for?
"Sorry but I can't understand why people wouldn't do any research considering you have a world of information at your fingertips. It's common sense to research something before you spend a lot of money. Considering the recent history of removing the SD card, the headphone jack and Bluetooth functionality from the spen, you would think people would have learned by now."

"as an artist, I need a true digitiser"
"I mean, having a core feature suddenly taken away after 7 years is quite unexpected. I've seen many other people talking about being blindsided by this change so it's not just me."
"my old contract still exists because I haven't sent my old Z Fold 6 back, I'm still within the cooling off period."
"Especially in this day of the information being seconds away, at your fingertips."
"yeahhhh I'm sure I'll consider your opinion on the quality of my work dude, grow up"
Why not just get a fold 6 then? I'm guessing you have one just keep it and wait no need to upgrade its not like your phone sucks its a awesome phone.
[removed]
They removed Bluetooth functionality from the spen on the s25 ultra and you didn't bother to do a 10 second google search on the fold 7. Gotta be smarter than that.
i haven't sent off my fold 6 and the contract is marked as complete. If you watch the staff on their computer you can see that they pay off the remainder of the contract
[deleted]
I'm literally a tattoo artist you doughball??
"Wdym they removed the Bluetooth functionality from the spen 25 ultra? I see the phone pictured with stylus?

Meaning no third-party pens?"
"I'm not disagreeing with you that a search would've been helpful. Obviously, it would've saved me the hassle of having to send back this phone that I no longer want.

But I keep reiterating: why would anyone expect a feature like this to be removed after 6 generations?

it's like needing to Google whether the next iPad pro has apple pencil support. Some things are just a given, and to me, this was one of them.

Have any other foldables removed digitiser support after 6 generations? It's just a bit unprecedented"
What is your problem? Keep scrolling weirdo
You can't use it to take pictures anymore or to use the air gestures.
I totally agree they should have the S-Pen functionality and Bluetooth functionality on their top to your phones but you have to take the time to do the research because nothing is guaranteed. If Samsung keeps cutting features and raising prices they're going to start losing a lot of customers.
"Maybe.  I dropped Samsung after they dropped removable batteries. Ended up going back, after other manufactures started doing the same."
"totally agree with you, but I've learned my lesson haha"
2 weeks? Are you secretly MKBHD?
I have the Gear 6 classic since it was released 2 or so years ago.  Don't see enough change in the 8 to make the move.
How‚Äôs the battery life? It looks a lot better in person than it does in the website renderings.
"I'm really enjoying mine although I've only had it about a day or so. You can get an adapter for other bands but I'm actually a real big fan of this change personally as this gapless band looks amazing with it.

https://preview.redd.it/180tg19fa8ff1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbc7cf687437723078ad3271523029305acf0fbd"
How? Didn't it just come out today?
I'll have to keep following y'all for how it is over time. My 6 is starting to give me weird tracking issues. For some reason it just stops tracking in the middle for the last month and it's driving me nuts.
"Congratulations! Is the watch smooth to use? I'm not gonna ask if its as smooth as an apple watch, but is it smoother as compared to the older models (eg Watch 4etc)?"
"I'm confused between 8 classic and the Ultra. 

I only care about performance and battery life. I've never used that rotating ring thing so I want to know: How useful is it? Does it come in handy or is it just a novelty feature that you use a few times but then get bored? (Like the S pen).

Ultra is actually cheaper compared to the 8 classic in my country so it's even more confusing because I'm guessing ultra would get a better battery?"
Battery life and features are crazy.
"So far im enjoying mine im upgrading from the 5 pro and the lag and freezing is totally gone. I do miss using facer app as they selection of watch faces is so much better. 

Otherwise I agree its much smoother and seems to hold up better and im glad for the upgrade."
"This watch is sick, I almost got the 8 I'm so glad I changed my mind!"
"I just ordered the Galaxy Watch 7 last night! I've never had a smart watch before, and upgraded my S8 phone to S25 Ultra earlier this year... was waiting on the Watch 8 but can't stand the ""squircle"" design, so I went for the Watch 7 that's so much cheaper anyway. Excited to get it tomorrow!"
OP what is your wrist width exactly can you share. I am bit confused wheather to buy a classic or based 4.0cm one as my wrist is so thin. But mind is tilting towards classic which has huge dial
"I just ordered my Watch 8, I currently have a watch 5. It's gonna be great!"
Got the new ultra on the 24th. I love it so far. I got it through T-Mobile pre-order
"Looks much better in person, the squarecle design is really growing on me. One UI 8 is not only looks nice but is very smooth. Battery life is good; I've never used AOD. Overall very pleased with the new design direction

https://preview.redd.it/e9047xf53qff1.jpeg?width=3059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f32388c13b88003f9aa818873b94a1689da05a6"
"I was skeptical about the look and feel of the 1st Gen Watch Ultra when it came out but I've been loving it. Only reason I'm not upgrading to the 2nd gen that just came out is that it's the same watch which more storage space. I have One UI Watch 8 on my 1st gen Ultra and it gives me all the new health features, so I'm happy staying with the 1st Gen Ultra."
Congratulations you downgraded a fair amount if you have the watch Ultra
I miss the turning dial but I can't live with a smaller screen
"https://preview.redd.it/el8lajbs88gf1.jpeg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613314e5ad84d7f44d9d6591048771abb6ae1f29

Got mine as well plus the flip 7 im in love"
"As someone who has partnered with Samsung, I‚Äôm so excited to try the running coach! Talk about going from the couch to running a 5k with a tailored program!"
"Initially, I held reservations regarding the aesthetic design of the inaugural Watch Ultra model. However, I have since developed a positive sentiment towards its performance. My reluctance to transition to the recently released second-generation model stems from its primary enhancement being increased storage capacity. Given that my first-generation Ultra device is currently operating on One UI Watch 8, which provides access to the latest health-related features, I am content with maintaining my current configuration."
"Do you need a Samsung? If you have another android phone will the features like heart rate, antioxidant etc work?"
Did anyone else get a little upset when they ordered the new watch 8 classic and there black version is literally chrome with a black bezel. Like this is not a black watch. This is a chrome watch with a black bezel
Can I use a Samsung ultra watch if I have a implanted medtronic defibrillator?
I went from the 3 to the 8 classic and am loving it. Looks great. Operates very smooth. I waited so long for the dial to come back. I wish I could pin messages to the top like on my phone though and also make a single contact widget/page. But really no complaints. It's a nice upgrade. I'm really liking the original band it came with too.
Didn't they just release yesterday from pre-orders?
"I wish... I know he bring in some good bread lol. I get called that sometimes though in my YouTube comments because I do tech and I'm ‚ú®Ô∏èblack‚ú®Ô∏è

But yeah basically Samsung flew me out to NYC for Galaxy Unpacked and gave it to me."
"My s22 can't run the new ONEui smoothly it's super laggy and I'm pissed, I'm wondering if anyone else has this problem"
Battery life is my reason
"My watch (Galaxy Watch8, 44mm, Graphite, LTE) drains about 1% every hour without always on display, but I use raise wrist to display. 

With battery saver I'm sure it would drain much less. I haven't worked out or used any calling, music, map features yet, I'm sure those would decrease battery life. I've mainly used it to track my sleep and steps.



I'm coming from a watch 4, so this is a huge jump for me"
Seems pretty close to 2 day battery life for me.
"That looks amazing, do you have a link for that?"
What face is that. it looks great.
"Yes. I made a crucial mistake and I'm glad you corrected me on that...

So Samsung flew me out to Galaxy Unpacked and gave it to me. Don't know how I messed that up but I hope this comment gets bumped to the top so people will at least know and not have that info be a secret."
You might want to think about a trade-in now before it totally comes out and it's worthless.
"well, my watch 7 ultra is almost the same as the galaxy watch I bought in 2018... it's overpriced. I wasted my $$$"
Super smooth. So far on par with my Apple Watch. Tizen definitely was.
I had a 3 I think with the rotating bezel.  I upgraded to a 5 a few years ago and miss the bezel when rotating through things like setting a timer and my finger seems too fat sometimes.
"Facer stopped working on my watch 6 classic after  software 
updates"
Yeah the lag on the 5 Pro when I had it over a year ago was crazy. I traded it in when the 2024 Ultra came out because they were giving $350 for the 5 Pro plus $50 pre-order (total was $400 off) so I only paid $250 for the Ultra. I'm glad I took advantage of it last year because I noticed they're not giving that high trade-in on that 5 Pro anymore.
"Wait, you did the run?!"
"No, you don't. You can use all of that even if you don't have a Galaxy phone."
"My s21 was fine, maybe there's something wrong with your phone"
Are you getting better battery life with the 8?  I was getting about 2 days on my 6 with light use
That‚Äôs far far better than I was expecting. Thank you!
"Yeah this one here. No adapter needed for it.
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCYDNYQ5?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share"
"Simple analog with some customizations. But I ended up switching to analog dashboard for more complications that I think looks pretty good too.

Edit the post and add that info.
Don't care about trade ins. I give my old tech to my parents.
"Oh really? Thanks, I'm seeing mixed comments. Some people saying you can't. Thanks"
In getting that with AOD. Didn't use to.
"Update: After 24 hours it's down to 70 percent. I used Gemini a few times but nothing crazy. 

I completely overlooked the fact that you can't wirelessly charge it with a phone. this was a big thing for me because I never carried around a watch charger.

Also there are some bugs that I notice. When I put it in sleep mode, raise to wake gets turned off and when I disable sleep mode, it doesn't turn back on and I have to manually do it each time.

Bigger issue: I got in my car with 300 steps. I drove for 30 minutes, now I have over 1500 steps.

These aren't things I've experienced on watches before."
"Damn that was quick, thanks a ton! The price is really good as well, whats the quality like if I may ask?"
"Doesn't give me that option. Can you do it on PC?

https://preview.redd.it/ml8lei41qbff1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=186b7e1d83ca777606905bb48258db490b1b628f"
" Oh, that makes sense. Just dump the watch that you're complaining about on Reddit on them. Sounds like they're in the position to appreciate any old scraps you toss them.  They must be so grateful. I used to give stuff like that to the kids or nieces and nephews. Had no idea I could have given my half working crap to my parents. Give the 'rents my best. üòâ"
Nah you can. I made a YouTube Shorts trying it.
I get the raise to wake and sleep mode issue as well occasionally on my watch7
Seems really good to me. Pretty heavy.
Oh really? Please may you share that? Or tell me your channel. Thanks
"Awesome, im gonna buy this right now, thanks a ton for the help!"
Got you! https://youtube.com/shorts/LoiNXFZqR3A?si=D0U5rT0seK3OC81o
No problem. Enjoy!
"Dude, you're the man! Thanks :)"
"No, thank you!"
You need a study to measure it? What did they do? Measure the thickness of other phones?
"Just got mine yesterday, almost a shame to put a case on it but it's a very noticeable upgrade over the 5 that I had even with. üòä"
"At the same time it's only Chinese brands lol. They lie about everything, about the years of updates, about the nits of the screens, about the battery life, about the finesse, about the photo lol."
"And the most over priced,  Sorry but the phone is NOT worth 3K CAD"
Dont get why Honor would boldly advertise the lineup as 8.8mm thick when it‚Äôs just for ONE SKU and not even the TOTAL thickness delivered to customers.
Now measure from its thickest point. Crazy how they ignore the camera mountain.
I have a Z Fold 3.  How do the cases on the 7 bulk it out?
Lol these bots go the farthest length possible to spread misinformation¬†
I now have a second-hand $700 for sale. Does anyone like it? It has only been charged 29 times.
"I‚Äôve been wanting out of the Apple ecosystem for years, saw this phone last night on tik tok and thought to myself ‚Äúwhat if I just go to the store on Saturday and buy it without telling anyone‚Äù

Because every time I consider the switch my social circle just roasts me about green texts üòÇ

Really want to do it, how do you like yours so far?"
should I upgrade from s23u?
I'm going caseless and getting Samsung Care. Phone is too nice to put a case over it and I want to be able to see the blue color
Is there a not Chinese brand to compare this too? Korean I guess?
"Who uses Chine phones anyways?

üëÄ ü§£"
"3k AUD as well...

Really want one, I can afford it with ease, it just seems like a stupid buy tho"
Other reviewers have measured the mountain between the 2 and the vivo was thicker too.
The camera bump doesn't count because it doesn't make the WHOLE phone thicker
Me or the person that made that news?
"I love it, but I loved my Fold 5 too and it's a pretty good upgrade. Having a big screen for apps or multitasking is my favorite.

Probably doesn't hurt to stop by and check one out anyway, I think they have 'em at Best Buy displays (or a Samsung store if you actually live near one of those). Seeing it hands on is probably better to decide if you'd like it or not."
"Made the switch back in 2018 when green text bubbles were even uglier and had less features because...SMS :(

Even then, zero regrets. Actually a really good reason to ask not to be included in group texts üòÇ"
Green texts?
"What are even these green texts? Because when I text my friends, some are green, some blue, some purple, some red, etc"
"Not yet, or at least wait to see if it got any issues, i use S24U and i want to upgrade to the Z Fold8 in autumn 2026 maybe"
"The bitter haters of Samsung and Apple I think, look r/oneplusopen lol"
"to be fair‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs cheaper if you use the deals. 

On Amazon, it‚Äôs less than 3000 and you get 300 Amazon voucher."
"Apples marketing is centered around a superiority complex and status. They use cheap and old androids in advertisements and people think that iPhones are just better in every way now here in the US. You will literally get bullied in school for not having an iphone. Been a Samsung user all time and when you actually ask an iPhone user what's better the reply is always ""no lag"" (like doesn't either and if anything mines smoother)  ""everything"" (basically saying you have no clue peak brainwash statement) or ""the camera is better"" (they take selfies for Snapchat and have 0 understanding of what makes a camera good or bad)"
"Apple has this thing where they bully non Apple users. it‚Äôs a cult type of thing.

The green bubble blue bubble."
"I had the fold 6 since day 1 and had no issues. 

I think most of the issues have stopped after fold 4 since they removed the gap. when the fold 4 had the gap, I was extremely scared of folding the phone.

If you have no use for the larger screen, it‚Äôs not for you. 
If you like to multitask alot using split screen, gaming etc, you will like it."
I upgraded my 24 ultra to a fold 6 and had no regrets.
"I use a OnePlus Open not because I‚Äôm a bitter hater, nor do most that I‚Äôve come across. The Open was cheaper than a Fold 5 at the time, with a different range of features than the competition. I think most have been unimpressed with Samsung‚Äôs stagnation until this year. The Fold 7 is an impressive product, and I would consider one if I can get it at a lower cost."
"oh shit nice, am def debating abt it now..."
"Just looked this up, seem like an American thing only tho

Basically its treated as a social rank to have blue text? Thats so dumb of ppl but smart move by apple

Happy that the main messaging app in my country is WhatsApp and no one even know about this stupid blue text green text thing"
"yup, 512gb is same price of 256gb and it‚Äôs 200 dollars off and on top 300 amazon credit. 2700 for 512gb and 300 amazon credit is a pretty good deal. good luck!"
"Yeah Europe especially, but the rest of the worlds seems to use WhatsApp which circumvents this whole deal. But also US is the only place where iPhone usage trumps android (by like 10% whereas worldwide Android wins with 70%."
where are you seeing $2700? its showing $2899 for me

legend. cheers bro
$2k man... I just cant justify spending that much on ANY phone.
I wanted to get this sooo bad (Had Fold 3 currently S23U) but when I held it with my large hands I had trouble opening it and it is so damn thin I am afraid I will break it plus the fact that it is a 2K plus purchase that is half my 9800X3D build I did just 4 months ago (other half is the graphics card :(
90$ a month for a phone for two years is insane
Really loving mine! Got it for $764.99 with trade in. Rocking the silver with dbrand leather skin and a screen protector. No case. Huge upgrade
"The price doesn‚Äôt worry me, I use my phone more than another object and I‚Äôm okay with paying ¬£2000. 

Never cheap out on things you use often, phone, bed, glasses‚Ä¶"
"Got mine last night.  Got unlocked this time directly from samsung.  Can't seem to update it.  Google play system update is May 1,  it shows a 13mb update available but fails at 60% every time I try to install it.  Same for the security update, it's at June 1 and shows nothing new.

My 2.5 year old S23U is on July 1 for both security update and google play system update.

But otherwise loving it so far.  First folding phone.  The wife saw it and is thinking of replacing her iphone 15 pro max with one."
"I purchased one moving away from an iPhone 15. The fold out screen is amazing and I'm happy to say i enjoy it as much as I hoped i would. 

What i didn't expect was samsung cheaping out on face scanning cameras (so face unlock only works in decent light).

Disappointed in a few other small areas, but that's mostly growing pains.  The cover screen scales just a little bit too small for example and the keyboard feels cramped there. 

Am impressed with the battery life and how the phone feels in general though!"
"I was looking at getting one, but Samsung isn't accepting the Pixel 9 Pro XL as trade on anything."
"Sorry for an off topic, whats this screen? Whats this feature?"
"Nice, how do you like it? I'm thinking about upgrading from my S23+, which I've had for a couple of years now. I think the new AI crap really killed my battery life. 

I only use my phone to browse the web, email, text, and watch a metric ton of YouTube. Should I stick with my S23+?"
Litreally the only phone to tempt me away from Pixel lol. I need to sleep on it or maybe get this during a sale.
The best version of Fold so far..
"If this phone had the same camera zoom range as the Ultra, I would buy it. But I can't give up my camera. At concerts it's more valuable than can be put into words

![gif](giphy|fJPofTQEsHa7Pg1OPz)"
I really want to trade my s25 ultra for this 7 but when I had the 6 I felt it was too fragile and im pretty sure the 7 feels more fragile being so thin. It is nice now. If I do get it would be the jet black
"I could get this for 1299 USD with a s23u trade in, or a z fold 6 for 600 and sell my s23u (some pixels are crushed)... idk what to choose üò¨"
"Saw it at the store yesterday, gorgeous."
Still the wrong shape and ratio on the outer display. And too expensive.
Congrats üåü
"Following the acquisition of a device transitioning from an iPhone 15, the foldable screen's performance has been exceptional, exceeding initial expectations.

However, the facial recognition camera's performance, particularly its reliance on adequate lighting, is a notable area for improvement.

While minor adjustments are anticipated, such as optimizing the cover screen's scaling and keyboard layout, the device's battery life and overall design are commendable."
With trade in it was like 900 bucks
Congratulations on the new PC. I am waiting to upgrade to the S26 Ultra from my S23 Ultra. Got the Watch Ultra 32GB at half the launch price. Now I have to wait for six months more for the S26 Ultra.
"A case helps A LOT if you have trouble to open the phone! 

If you are afraid of breaking the device, you don't have to. Look at these extreme tests this dude made and the phone still survived: https://youtu.be/ipr-zBUufxw"
I cant do payments anymore.  Paid my 24u off in 4 payments of 214 or so back in january.
Whatcha trade in?
Office chair too... got a 3K CAD chair and no regrets
Agreed!
Lol
"I‚Äôm pretty sure we are looking at the new ‚ÄúNow Brief‚Äù AI menu, it essentially compiles all your recent notifications and other information you deem important into a neat lil quick view menu"
Its the now brief page
I love using this phone im just happy it gets me thru the day despite having the 4400 Mah battery.  Go get it man!
Right now only the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has the same zoom as the ultra (optical 5x). At least if you live in the USA or Canada.
Nope it doesn't have the same zoom as the s25 ultra
"1,5k for 1tb version with fold6 trade in"
"I really hope the S26U is worth it, I only got the S23U because my S22U broke and Samsung Care+ did not have any Unlocked 1TB S22U anymore since it was 3 months into the release of the S23U so i got it free of charge but the S24U and S25U were just awful rising costs and taking away feature after feature that made the Ultra series what it was a FREAKING NOTE!"
"I'm still using my S21U, have seen no reason to upgrade from Samsung"
"Yeah case has been a game changer for opening, highly recommend"
"I did not notice that for the fold. At that point, 4 payments of 500$ would be necessary"
Z Fold6
I have a $3500 msrp office chair I got free from an office being updated and it is the best chair I have owned. Can sit in it comfortably for many hours.
"With pre-order storage discount of 150, then the 100 dollar reserve credit, and the educational discount if possibly you could've had it for around 1100-1200. That's around flagship prices of other brands but it is very expensive. That's why I don't get 1tb. I wish I could get a 100 dollar discount for getting the 256gb instead of the 512 upgrade since I don't need 512."
"Prior to the S23U, I had the S21 Ultra. It was a good phone as well."
What case do you use for the fold 7?
"Still better than the 24 month payments of $55.

I use Mint also so I dont have a phone bill either.

Long gone are ny monthly phone bills of $150 with mobile ü§£"
"I went with this one for now ....

https://amzn.eu/d/0gYtR3U

However I wouldn't suggest it, the back of the case is great (although it is as thick as the phone) however the front stated it had a glass screen protector built in bit it's plastic, the part by the loud speaker blacks most chargers so you have to open the phone slightly and wireless charging doesn't work (not tried a power bank to attach to the magnet yet) I've actually been refunded on it by Amazon so on look out for another.....bit opening and closing is great ü§£"
Mint gives free service? How do they make money
I pay every 3 months for unlimited everything 150.  I'd pay for service for the whole year for $300 but just haven't yet.
I pay every 3 months for unlimited everything 150.  I'd pay for service for the whole year for $300 but just haven't yet.
"It shows 25$ a month per line, which is what I pay at T-Mobile. Exactly the same actually. Except I have waaaaay more data than mint offers."
"Yea thats gotta be a promo.

Years ago my mom and I are were paying like 300 a month.  2 unlimited lines, 2 regular flip phone lines for the grandparents, and paying off 2 iphones. 

Even when we finished paying off the phones the lowest we got it was like 200 bucks before I left and got my own mint line."
4 phones for about 200-225$ seems standard these days.30-60$ per phone depends on how much data or quality you want
Great now you cant even customize the taskbar
"I just want to have the option of windows 11 arm in my already snapdragon elite device. This thing literally has 16gb ram and 1 tb of storage, the same as my asus pz13. I need windows for a couple things and android for others. Dex is great but for me is like an emergency OS."
So every year we expect Samsung to remove features one by one. great idea
I think more features are coming from Google in the future that . Even more classic Dex had
Their next phone is going to remove all features and it'll just be air.
"Shit article 

Absolute click bait"
Okay they killed it and there's a reason blah blah. I'll stay quiet and just miss the good old time I can still customize the taskbar.
"I love how I originally got into Samsung phones due to various features, but everything is going away. Every single phone will be literally the same thing. Fuck everything."
Im not sure what to feel on this i love Dex to progress but for how long before I can use it the way I used to use it??
Did they at least fix the battery icon?
"The recent changes have been implemented, and the rationale behind them is understood. While I will refrain from further comment, I do find myself reminiscing about the previous functionality, particularly the ability to customize the taskbar."
A 21qm
"Everything is broken, I have  the xreal ar glasses and the experience is so bad now."
"I‚Äôm hoping that with the upcoming merge of ChromeOS and Android that Google‚Äôs other upcoming feature of native desktop mode, they‚Äôd make it so that the desktop mode opens up as ChromeOS and not just a big Android interface. That way we still get a fully usable desktop mode even if Samsung kills DeX."
I'm probably going to throw some money at a linux tablet someday.
Did you see the Huawei laptop with dual OS? That's a dream for an Android device
Following Microsoft's strategy to impress customers by treating them with disdain.
"Samsung features are underappreciated or mocked as gimmicks or bloat until you realise they're taking them away or they become standard android features.


Multi-window. S-pen. DEX. And a whole lot more."
"It's because Android's own and native version of DeX is coming soon, by Google.

Honestly, it doesn't sit well with me either, but Google better not fuck this up like they do with millions of other shits they fucked up. Samsung better pressure and whip Google."
Did you even read the damn article...
[deleted]
But i need those lost features now not in some unforseeable future.
"My issue is Google are not good at following thought with improving ""niche"" feature like this"
"I think the merger of Android and ChromeOS will bring some kind of desktop functionality. When you connect your compatible phone to a monitor/TV, it may display the ChromeOS UI and all your phone's files will be there. At least that's what I expect from this merger."
I know. Sadly we can't get them in the US
Samsung has screwed up things too and Google had to help them. Honestly both companies should stay far away from Software.
"""However, the new DeX is currently a downgrade for users, as it lacks many quality-of-life features that were present in the classic version."""
"They will ‚Äúmigrate‚Äù chromeOS :) 
We will see"
That‚Äôs exactly what I was talking about. I hoped it would happen with Linux on DeX but Samsung destroyed those dreams so I hope Google actually pulls through.
"According to me, what's happening is, Google and Samsung are collaborating more closely. And when Samsung sees in advance what Google is building, they are deciding to wait for Google to build the new APIs and then build features on top of it."
I hope that is the case. Would probably make me switch back to Android just for the tinkering capabilities.
Next generation will have a squircle screen to fill the squircle body
"I don't mind the squircle, in fact it's a nice balance between rounded square and a circle design, but **if you're going for a squircle chassis**, **you should put on a squircle display.** Otherwise it's a waste of space, especially when every millimeter counts for watch hardware.."
I prefer circle over squircle
"much much better in person

It‚Äôs called pincushion.  Classic analog/mechanical watch case design. Aviator type watches such as Panerai use this design at times. It‚Äôs a beautiful silhouette.
Hate it.
Looks like wasted space. Don't like it at all.
uggo
If the screen is the same shape then I'll be fine with it since I like squircle icons.
"Looks better in person than in pics. Feels light and sleek. Have the 44mm version, received today.

https://preview.redd.it/asjx3t5jyxef1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aea2496c29faa4f369a91ce89937256beb43992d"
"Poor design, should have made the screen the same or the body the same, now it looks just off.

No reason to upgrade for me with those looks."
I don't like it. I just want to go back to the circle design.
Nope. Not for me. But im glad they brought back the physical rotating dial for the new classic.
"I just received mine today. I have been wearing it now for 5 hours. I upgraded from the Watch 6 40mm to the Watch 8 44mm. The Squircle design actually looks nice on the wrist. Having some contrast to just the screen is pretty pleasant on my eyes. Additionally, even though it is bigger it feels lighter maybe due to the larger space to dissipate the weight on the wrist? I do really enjoy it a lot. Just going to see how it goes going forward but there's only one complaint I have is the sport band has some twine on it and I didnt know that. Im afraid it will become dirty against the white band."
The case shape is very similar to some 1970s dress watches. But they made it comically large and added a screen. Yeah no.
This is so dumb! Just make a circle model AND a square model. Done!¬†
"I quite like the looks of it but I haven‚Äôt seen one in person, so I can‚Äôt really judge"
I like it!
Mixed reactions.. Feels weird with excess bezels or something haha
"I hated it in photos. But when I received mine, I loved it. It looks spectacular in person."
"I've been wearing the 8 classic for 3 days now. I'm ok with the shape, it's growing on me. My issue is the lack of bands to back it up. The band it comes with is a pathetic attempt at being an all round every occasion leather but not leather band that looks undersized for the watch. I have 2 metal bands from alliexpress that arrived before the watch and both of them look better but are of lower quality. Samsung needs to make a good quality, solid metal band."
"I'm wearing it and i don't really care, i hardly even notice when just looking at it"
It looks better in person
Literally not even bad. I don't get the hate. It's stupid.
Ugly
It's a square that I can't get my head around it.
Looks good on the classic but really bad imo on the basic 8.
Love it. Might upgrade my 7.
Looks silly. If they‚Äôre going to make it that shape just have a larger screen. If they‚Äôre going to have a round screen don‚Äôt make the watch that shape.
I hate the word squircle more than the design tbh XD
I don't hate it.
"I don't hate it tbh. It's a relatively common shape in actual watches, too."
"I'm in the dislike/hate camp. The regular Watch 8 looks great but the shape still throws me. The 8 Classic looks terrible by comparison. I was a big fan of the round shape mostly because it stood out and had a uniform design that said ""yeah this is a Samsung device."" I got tons of compliments on my 5 Pro and 4 (40mm) and I'd even have people come up and say ""omg is that a round Apple Watch"" or any other compliment about the watch. 

Personally all I wanted from Samsung was to keep the same design, add a rotating crown for the base models and the Ultras, and keep the rotating bezel for the classic. The Action Button looking like a crown but not functioning as one is a huge step back IMO especially when every other manufacturer has one. I know the Classic doesn't need a crown but still."
"I have have the Galaxy watch 7 44mm and when they announced it and I saw it, I didn't like it. But when I went to best Buy to look at the Fold 7 and they had it on display. It's really nice in person and made me considering upgrading but I'll think I'll wait for the next generation!

![gif](giphy|iicDrNGWxHmDrIni6j|downsized)"
"really pathetic, the ui is actually square they should just make square screen at this point instead of trying to look like apple half baked"
I love it. Just got my Ultra!
"If the display was the same shape, I might like it. But like this, not really."
i think it took the inspiration from 2017 galaxy gear sport / previous gw ultra
Ass
At this point we need a sticky for everyone's views on the gw8 and gw8c because fucking hell
Hate it. Absolutely hate it.
Not a fan at all. Feels like an apple watch. Ugly tiny washing machine
If it's squarcle make it with low bezel and whole screen üòÅ
"If squircle is the body, squircle should be the screen, and tbh this mix n match with circle screen is just very much meh"
Gross. Gonna stick with my 7 for 4 generations like last time. Hopefully the next one will just be made of light or some shit.
I dont understand why samsung hates matt black. Why???
"Seems better to me, also provides somewhat of a protection to the screen, if I bump the watch on something"
in fact I really really fucking like it id buy it if i had the money
"Ugly, I will never get it."
"I think my classic looks great and if the design makes for bigger battery, I'm all for it."
It's gorgeous
"Uggy, eiter squer or sirkle"
Ugly
Terrible
I think this design is refreshing.
Would like but wouldn't hate it too
"I think overall, it‚Äôs a nice looking watch."
Don't like it. Wish Samsung would keep on design language to the ODD years and keep the CLASSIC CIRCLE design to even years. Keeping my W6C
Fugly
"Squirky.

Personally I want hard square edges, or fuck it, a triangle!"
Trash...
"It's Samsung's thing (their stock icons clue in to this), and it being used in physical designs has grown on me a ton, especially with the Watch8 Classic...that watch has to be my favorite design they've released yet."
"I struggle to understand why they did it. I neither hate it or like it, I just don't understand why"
"I like it, got the Watch 8 classic and is really nice, looks and feels expensive and also liking One UI 8."
I love it. And I love the new redesign with the way the band connects to the watch. I had no idea they changed everything up.i just got mine yesterday.
"Honestly, after seeing it person and wearing it, I don't mind it. I hated it at first!"
"I thought I would hate it. But, when I went to the store and used it for myself, it looked really good, I would even go as far as to say, I liked it more than the circular one. 
Its one of those things that you need to give time to sink in. Try to view it without thinking it as a waste of screen real estate and you may like it. 
Its form over function, gives it a nice personality imo."
Too much hate for not a big reason. People on the internet WILL hate on everything.
Tenho um e gosto no pulso.
It looks so clean and minimalistic
Looks pretty tbh. Easily recognizable
I'm liking it
waiting for them to slowly make the squircle even sharper and basically turn it into an apple watch clone
"Honestly I love it. I never liked a full circle design and I have always loved Apple watch design look of that rounded square. So to me, this is best of both worlds. Still a circle screen but with a squircle design that I do like. Only thing I do not like is that I am a skinny man and a 40m watch 8 looks ""big"" on my wrist but I am also used to smaller watches like a Casio F91W. Taking a minute to get used to the size but I adore it regardless.

EDIT: Also this watch is LIGHT! I barely notice I have it on my wrist until I look and go ""oh there it is""."
"https://preview.redd.it/7mytfaq10cff1.jpeg?width=2070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=067a0005fb2fbd60d82a66db778ef0cc3d5e0877

I was an avid hater of the squircle design, then I checked the watches out in person and I can honestly say, they really aren't that bad. The watch 8 looks a little strange but it's not bad, but the classic is actually beautiful. Best buy had them while preorders were still in, tried it out and immediately bought one online. Now rocking it with a metal band, and it's so good looking. theres also a bunch of features that are so much better, one being the default watch wall paper now has a low light mode where it turns all green in the dark to preserve night vision. I think you just have to view them in person to get a good gauge on them."
"Honestly as a long time samsung watch user, since gear 3 until watch 5 pro, fuck samsung watches. I was bored with my watch 5 pro but there was 0 reasons to upgrade to 7th series, ultra had the same battery but 2x the price, i switched to garmin instinct 2x solar. Yes it is not touch screen and screen is black and white. But i get mostly the same funcions with 2-6 week long battery life. Would switch back to samsung if they made something similar. I want my watch to look like a watch not a smartphone on wrist"
"Don't like it at all, 

But I tell you one thing if they ever get rid of the circle and make it the full screen that shape, watch will amazing."
it's beautiful. best looking watch imo
"I like it, even though the shapes don't match I think Samsung has done it in a very clean and, albeit a bit goofy, but professional way. I like it"
"I think the squircle design is nice, the implementation at this stage is a debatable, but the idea is nice. By default Samsung's app icons are squircles, it fits with that 

But I do agree, it needs a squircle screen"
More concerned with battery life than design
"I have the Watch 8 Classic and absolutely love the design. From the 6 Classis, the bezzle doesnt rotate on its own laying in bed like the previous model which I like"
"Love it, I don't understand the hate behind it. It stands out from the sea of circles and it is a traditional watch shape as well."
I somehow find it novel in a subtle way. Haven't figured out how to describe it. Maybe I'll get used to its look more later.
"I dont mind the more squared body, but damn is that ultra minimalist watch face useless."
"I got the classic, makes it look more premium but its actually not that noticeable either"
"Love it, I've already ordered one!"
"I was going to upgrade my Watch5 Pro but these designs r so ugly im switching to Apple. getting a series 10 and keeping my 5 Pro for blood oxygen other than that bye bye S24 sadly and bye Watch5 Pro. It was nice being in Android but UI 7 is so much worse than UI 6,1 imo and I hate the new One UI Watch 8 software and hate the squircle design prefer either a full square or a circle but neither r done here"
Much worse in person if the 9 series isn't circle I'm not getting it
I really like it üôÇ and the design was the main reason why I got myself watch 8. It looks different and fresh when compared to let‚Äôs say AW 10. Kudos to Samsung üëç
"I like the simplicity of the scaled-down look. but a circle in a square (the physical look) is ugly. Looks like not cut precisely, or like the leftover material when you build something, but didn't finish it."
"It's dumb. They are trying to have a square watch like Apple but still keep the circle screen they are known for. Why can't these companies just try to make their products better for the consumers and not to try and copy each other? They got rid of the curved screen not because it wasn't as functional but because others had a flat screen. Apple started it, then Google made all their phones for the series 9 look just like an iPhone, and then Samsung followed.

The curved screen may be harder to use one-handed, harder to find a screen protector that works and easier to crack, but it makes the phone look sexy as hell and I personally would pick it over a boring flat one."
I received mine today. I returned mine today lol. Decided to keep the watch7 because it looked better on my wrist.
"Upon initially encountering the squircle design, I held reservations. However, after a hands-on evaluation of the watches, I must concede that the aesthetic is more appealing than anticipated. While the Watch 8 presents a somewhat unconventional appearance, it is not unappealing, and the Classic model exhibits a particularly refined design. Following an in-store trial during the preorder phase at Best Buy, I promptly purchased a unit online. Currently, I am utilizing it with a metal band, and the overall appearance is quite favorable. Furthermore, the device incorporates several enhanced features, including a low-light mode for the default watch wallpaper, which transitions to a green hue in darkness to conserve night vision. I recommend an in-person assessment to fully appreciate the design and functionality."
"I feel like the Classic and Ultra looks just fine to me, but the base looks off yeah. This shape language doesn't fit the minimalist design that Base wants to do."
"https://preview.redd.it/gfvn4ein4hgf1.jpeg?width=1868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8721a7d0554a2d1e7799bd68eefced584b40d0c3

Loving it so far!"
"Not a fan of it actually, the circle design looks much more like an actual watch"
Originally hated it... but now i like it. Just wish it offered more functionality than it already does
I'm more upset about the lack of a all black version. Nope we get chrome with a black bezel. When my 6 classic is completely black.
"I'm not a fan, I love my round watches. The new 8 Classic feels so cheaply made too, I was surprised!"
Squircle is fun to say
very cool!
UGLY AF
Reminds me of Panerai. I do not like Panerai designs.
I don't hate it and I don't get the hate.
Just looks basic 2 me
"ngl the main reason that the galaxy watches are prob my favourites (please note i never had one so this is just based on looks) was because of the circle design, so i *personally* hate it now"
I swear it would benefit people so much if reddit would just implement a search function. Why they haven't yet is beyond me!
"Not a fan, I think it looks ugly.¬†"
I wouldn't hate that...
"If I wanted that, I'd get apple ü§¢"
I think it was done intentionally just to support addition of rotating ring which is loved by many.This will help them generate more revenue that prev gen.
Looks nice!
Mine is being delivered today and wow i think i made the right choice going for the graphite color that you have. That looks amazing! Even better than the brighter silver one.
Took me a while lol
Ayy it looks very elegant
Very good looking
? It was always on the Classic
That would have been nice
I didnt like it from the pictures but after getting the watch its not so horrible and noticable
I thought i wouldnt like it but i really love the design in person
"Exactly, god forbid a brand actually tries to make something new and unique in a well executed way. This isn't the first time a squricle watch was made by a company. And for those people who say a circular screen doesn't make sense in a square body, it's a side effect of wear os because wear os is optimised and designed for circular displays.

(this is coming from a watch 6 44mm user so don't come at me for not having used a circular watch)"
"Square is objectively an better shape for a smart watch. I want Samsung to make a new version of the gear S but with no bezel or main button. So it's a large 3""+ screen that wraps on your wrist"
Why
...does that color not exist for the 8?
https://preview.redd.it/yz9kxqtcxbff1.jpeg?width=2152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4c93a12108baf5d940743f18ee6c8f24a671dcc
squircle screen on a squircle body would look so much better than whatever the hell this is
"Same. And I see they are getting slimmer, but I like a thicker watch. Give it some bulk and weight. Just my preference."
"my thoughts exactly... More reason to keep my older Classic watch. Something about a circle screen is just nice to look at, and easy to make a watch face on."
"yes!! for me it is much better, the silver one it too much of a contrast. Enjoy it!"
"I also have a Watch6 but in 40mm. These are the type of people to glaze the living crap out of the Watch6 Classic just cuz it's ""Iconic"""
That's my largest issue with this. What's the point of the exta size of the body when the screen is just what we used to have.
Totally agreed why that gap between eh? Doesn‚Äôt look that good :(
My brother has an s9. Its battery is still really healthy.
I gave my previous S24+ to my mom and its battery (according to AccuBattery test) was around 98% after 13 months of use.
"My S21 bought half a year after release was around 77% a few weeks ago. So around 23% in 4 years.

Hoping my S25U will go on for even longer"
"I've an S9+ that has degraded to around 33% of its original 3,500 mAh capacity. Used a USB tester and it only inputs around 1,000+ mAh before charging stops and it really shows where the SOT maxes out 2 hours tops

Currently I'm on an S24+ and that also has a battery problem where if the battery level dips to 15% and below, you better charge it ASAP or else the phone will be dead in minutes"
"ADB dumpsysbattery a few months ago said my S22U was sitting at 93% battery health, and I've had the phone since launch 3.5 years ago. Used to limit battery to 80%, then turned that off, and now I'm doing 95%"
"My S23U is at 95% after around 2.5 years of use (got it launch day).  I charge it up to 100% every night,  sometimes need a top up or two during the day depending on how heavily I've been using it.  Never babied the battery and after 2.5 years it's still at 95%.  ADB shows 95%,  accubattery says 85%."
"My S22u now has 87% of original battery capacity (accubattery).  I try to keep it charged between 20-80%, and I use many of the phone's built-in power saving features when I'm out and about and on battery."
How do you guys test out the batteries or see the health of it? I‚Äôm an iPhone person and have an S22 Ultra to play around with.
"95% at 28 months, s23u"
It doesn't take years to lose battery.  Just one bad update (UI 7)
"Sitting around 65% on my S10, which for an over 6 year old phone isn't half bad"
How to check on my S22+
"Accubattery estimates 101% battery health for my S24. Bought used a few months ago. 80% max charge is set.


iphone se 2020 which was bought at launch and used for 5 years was at 74% battery health and roughly 1375 cycles. With a year or two of that being mostly wireless charging."
"https://preview.redd.it/cnidqwlg5aff1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f7f6078b6a770349322288eb1938b94ae5ebd64

Half of the year with my S24+ and I still have 102%. I don't use Battery Protection and charge my phone with a wireless charger all the time."
"Had an s22, had to delete everything off of it, and it still would lose a complete charge in an hour. So, rather than carry an external battery all the time, I had to upgrade to an s25. I hate the thing, but it keeps a charge most of the day at least."
"Can't tell the exact degradation precent, but my s22U will sometimes last 7 hours, or the battery will drain from 100% to 20% in 2 hours, no in between.  I have ordered the new flip 7, as i've always wanted it since the flip and fold series were introduced, but waited for more improvements and kinks to be worked out. Now is the time i said!"
im still on stock firmware and I get like 2 days of battery life lol
"According to battery, I have 84% battery health left.. And I have a galaxy s10e bought and used since 2019 so it's been 6 years.. how cool is that? I even flashed custom rom one UI 7 Android 15 on this little beast

https://preview.redd.it/vl5vceftpoff1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcaaf460f6e94b5283641b57c13e47992ef10477"
"My 23+ lost a lot. I didn't even realize it until I upgraded to my 25 ultra very recently. I'd have to do a major charge on the 23+ once or maybe even twice throughout the day. With my 25U I can generally get a full day with medium to light use, or maybe one small charge with heavy use"
I have an A54 that I only ever fast charge and after almost 2 years its at 88% original capacity with 812 battery cycles.
"My tab S8 I have set to 80% and try to charge at 15 to 20%. I follow Sakitech and set every thing to reduce battery use. Screen brightness down, resolution down. There were others I can't remember. Three years in and if fully charged when I go to bed, only looses around 3% in 9 hours. My note 20 at 4 half years was loosing 30% A week ago had to upgrade to new phone, S25 ultra 256  I am retired and live on my own and use tablet 12 to 14 hours a day so it cops a hiding."
"One of my best friends as well, he refuses to upgrade lol"
"Ah ok, good to know. I might crack the Note 9 open to do a battery swap, but I'm guessing no more water resistance after that."
Seems like AccuBattery (free app) works pretty well if you give it a few days. You can delete it afterwards¬†
Impressive! Are you using the charge limiting/protect battery feature?
"You can try the AccuBattery app and just run it for a few days, letting the battery run down to 15% or lower and then charge it up."
Which app is that?
"No more water resistance regardless, it is such an old device that the seals have degraded anyways over that time."
"Nope, I think I just got lucky!"
"https://preview.redd.it/pidraih6knff1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fab0b358ab27688444fdc06844f9bb9f3a40d8e5

Battery Guru. You need to allow it to measure your electrical current while the phone is charging for at least 60%. If you have Battery Protection enabled, measurements will be less accurate - use my first screenshot as an example - for the first third I had BP enabled and points are more out of line."
Thank you!
Apple too. Capitalism is running out of steam and ideas. They can‚Äôt create new so they cut corners to generate the new revenue.
"Base model? Plus? Ultra?

I've had an S21 base and now an S25+. Both have been pretty spectacular."
Same and I used to be a huge Samsung fan. Also the products are starting to get uglier (looking at the galaxy watch 8) and/or looking the same (comparing S series to A series and I‚Äôm sure the other series too but I live in the US and those are the only 2 series here). Sorry for this long run on sentence. I‚Äôm also not completely in love with One UI 7. These are just my opinions though.
"I've felt the same way, and in the last two months have switched to a OnePlus Watch 3 from my 6 Classic, and a Motorola Razr Ultra from my Flip 5. So far I've been extremely happy with both. I still rock my Buds Pro 3 and my Tab S7+, but the tablet might be the next to go."
"S4/5 to S23U, had probably about 70-80% of their flagships, but I eventually gave up. Mainly because of camera experience (solving shutter lag seems impossible) and ‚Äúwe‚Äôll fix it with updates lies‚Äù. Spend first year waiting and hoping for updates (for fixing basic things that should work perfectly out of the box), as soon as next model is presented you get slight ‚Äútime for new one‚Äù hints after updates, after 2-3 years it‚Äôs just easier to go out and buy new one. Which will become exactly the same as time goes by. Not the same company anymore‚Ä¶"
"Being a Samsung user since S3 too, I am still appalled that Samsung is still doing region lock on bands. That means if you want to be fully compatible with the network in a country, you must buy it from the country itself. No other phones have that restriction. That has been a very old practice and is way too annoying for this globalized world."
"Flagships should easily last 3-4 yrs. If we're spending this much and still get thermal throttling and poor battery, something's wrong"
"Left Samsung for Apple. Hardware is better, but things aren‚Äôt perfect overall and they do lock you in a bit."
After 8 Samsung flagships I jumped into apple.  It's not perfect but it's a breath of fresh air for me. Battery also lasts way longer than my S24U which is a huge plus for me.
"Coming from an A9 2018 which I would have liked if it had an exynos so I could custom ROM it because they left it at oneui 2.0. Ever since they removed the headphones jack, I just waited and Motorola made the G stylus 2025. Headphones microsd and a pen."
"my only concern is they're shoving that Exynos down our throats.

while they've been trying to hardsell Exynos' improvements in recent years, its notoriety of being linked to overheating issues has never ceased from discouraging me to pick a phone with that chipset.

i'd always pick Snapdragon over Exynos, regardless of what ppl are saying.

the last phone i had with Exynos was Note8."
"It think you've just had bad luck with your phones. Are you leaving them out in the sun? xD I've also been using Samsung phones for a very long time and my S10e, Fold 3 and S23 Ultra still work perfectly today"
"I would suggest to also stop updating samsung devices. If it works well when you buy it, just leave the updates alone, disable them from developer menu and from the settings menu."
"Yes, but you also need to consider how they are having to cram all those titbits in such a compact, slim and light enclosure, just so you - the customer - can say that you enjoy them. IR scanner, LiDAR, fingerprint sensor, 100‚ÄØMP+ camera sensor, high-quality speakers, big battery, powerhouse chip and RAM, 5G/Wi‚ÄëFi 6 modules, vapor chamber cooling‚Ä¶ remove all that, and you will have a far more reliable device that can last for years. Like a Nokia which is just a plastic shell, rubber keypad, and a board that can store the whole 384‚ÄØkB of data sandwiched together.

Modern phones are no longer built for longevity. They‚Äôre engineered to deliver the experience of the latest technological feats for a few years, until something newer arrives. That‚Äôs the trade‚Äëoff we could either accept and move along in the line, or go back to Nokia.

Same goes for cars. You know why Toyotas or Hondas last the longest? Cus they don't have all those Bi-turbo, TwinPower, Kompressor technologies, their compression ratio is 9.6:1, they go from 0 to 60 in like 3 days. They don't have radars, 3000 different sensors, electronic brakes, auto headlamps, massage seats. Nothing."
"I currently have an S25U but have been pretty curious about Pixel for a few years now (best friend mains an older model and swears by it). I ordered a used 9 Pro XL to play with and see what I think about it. 

Watching some videos I really prefer the wackiness Google is cooking up with Material 3 Expressive over One UI 8, and of course interesting things like call screening and stuff. Not to mention the camera processing (mostly personal opinion though). 

It seems Google is edging out the 5000 mAh battery with a 5200 mAh cell in the 10 Pro XL if rumors are to be believed. We'll see what I think about the 9 XL though first. 

I do really like how easy it is to flash a new OS onto though as well."
"My thoughts exactly. I have experienced a similar decline in battery performance with my base S23. While the initial battery life exceeded a full day, after 2.5 years, I now require charging twice daily, with a screen-on time (SOT) of around 4 hours.."
"I've had nothing but really good experiences with Samsung except with the s22 series (terrible battery) s23, s24 were excellent and the s25 ultra even better. I sold my laptop because of the flexibility with the s25 ultra, no other phone can replace that."
"S20E user - it gets so hot, in winter, I could use it as a hand warmer"
"I've been using Samsung for a long time. Using the a53 and it still runs like a dream, its battery is also great. If your having battery issues thats probably something you might be doing wrong i.e using all the battery before charging it. As for overheating, theres a mode that just completely uncaps your system and it can cause overheating so look for it"
Get the Fairphone 6. It's self repairable and comes with a 5 year warranty.
Amen
The updates progressively make everything worse too. I wish I could revert.
"Z Fold 7 absolutely slam dunks on that narrative.¬†
Frankly I think all R&D has been going to the fold and in another 10 years non-folding phones will be obsolete.¬†


The 7 Fold is the best device Samsung has ever made.¬†"
"I've had an s9+, s20fe 5g uw, S23 ultra and now s24 ultra that's a few months old. All of them have only lasted 2 years and then battery problems got really bad."
"I'm about the same as you. Had probably about 6 or so different models over the years. 

The problems are becoming more aggravating, not to mention that we have to typically troubleshoot on our own time. We should be getting paid for that time. The thought of making a phone call for help is a nightmare in itself. Have the S25 Ultra since about Feb. Can't charge it using the cable it came with. Will tell me moisture detected immediately. So I'm using an old Samsung USB to USBC cord and I get fast charging perfectly, taking a little over an hour when less than 20%. 

Samsung always stresses how we should be using their cords, wall chargers, wireless chargers, etc. Well we would if they'd cut the price down and make better products. There are a few things I wanted to get and the Samsung items had poor reviews. So I don't know what they want from us or are expecting of us when they're saying our cord (the Ultras) has to be able to handle 4A with PPS mode (info I got from another Reddit thread). Why make it so difficult Samsung? I know I usually get a new phone every 2 years so giving my phone issues, especially so early on, makes me start to rethink my next phone purchase. 

Others issues I'm having or had and I have yet to find the right answer (get frustrated looking or don't have time):

- my S Pen wouldn't stay locked in my phone for a week or 2 (& I had others try to get it to stay & couldn't)
- can't get into Galaxy store for last few days
- feel like my permissions get all screwed up after an update 
- suddenly I can't pair my TV to my phone (was working fine since I got the phone, don't know what happened)

I know there's more but can't think of them all right now. All I know is I'm sick of trying so many fixes that don't work when I'm troubleshooting. And I just don't have the brain capacity for it most of the time"
"I am in the Samsung ecosystem and feel that it's actually getting better. My phone is the S22 Ultra. I've had it 3 years and it's still going strong, to the point that I don't feel a strong desire to upgrade even though I know I'm missing out on newer features."
"I am a very big fan of samsung. My first device was a samsung J3 (2017). Then the J8. My first (and very successful) samsung S series was the S20FE. I went with it for about 4 years, unfortunately its battery I killed playing mobile games on fast charge. A year ago I decided that it was too expensive to change the battery, so I decided to change to something newer. My choice was S24. I've been using it for a year now, and honestly I can't say anything bad about it. I have enough charge for the whole day (I do not play games, just normal use), the camera suits me, in his work so far no problems. The only thing is that the latest UI update made me a little depressed. Overall I don't have any negative feedback about my experience with the brand other than the updates. Maybe I've just been lucky with the devices I've bought"
"I wholeheartedly agree.  I'm DONE with this brand. Permanently. I've had two Flip 5s and the @$&#  factory screensaver has started to bubble up on both of them. Now they won't repair it under extended warranty because they consider an accessory. BS! An accessory by it's very definitioni is something ADDED to the original product--not some lame ass job from the factory. 

In addition,  I've $#@& had it with them stripping out the audiophile Bluetooth codecs off their phone EVERY YEAR and giving some BS answer as to why they're doing it (The real answer being they want to push their lame proprietary codec and their crappier earbuds).  First they are hypocrites because they chastise apple with removing the headphone jack and then do the same thing. Without a headphone jack and no decent Bluetooth codex, how the @&#$ am I supposed to listen to this thing with any kind of decent sound?

But he LAST straw was an attempt to get the flip 7 for some reason and without warning before the pre-sale ended they took away the double memory offer just like that with like an hour left so I couldn't get 512 without paying an extra couple hundred dollars.  Of course when I tell this to their chat what happened they completely deny it and tell me I'm out of luck.  No you're out of luck cuz I'm going to tell everyone I know to avoid this unethical company like the plague from now on!!


C-ya Samsung... Don't let the $#@& door hit your @$$ on the way out!"
"I'm with you. I'd been iPhone for years and then their battery life issues made me switch to my S9+.  That phone was so amazing I thought I would never consider going back to Apple. When the 9 stopped getting security updates, it made me uncomfortable so i moved to S24+ a year ago. I hate it. It gets hot for no reason and this week, it wouldn't charge. I'm thoroughly disgusted. I miss my 9+ because even at 5 years, it had great battery life and not a single issue."
"The accessibility and privacy have become non-existent. 
I want a Phone where I MYSELF decide when my camera is on. I MYSELF should not have to worry about Samsung viewing my location, camera, audio, texts, calls,and app usage. Its unconstitutional, and with the monopolistic nature of today's businesses, there is no real option.. did I agree to the terms and conditions? Yes, but technically, under duress since today's standard is that you basically require a cell phone. I had to agree because I was afraid to lose my job, not because I agree. Dear Samsung, since I agreed to send my data, does that mean I can send you my state of the art ai designed to treat your company how you treat us?"
Completely agree with you. Have been using Samsung phone since 2013 and S25 Ultra and their crappy customer service really make me want to move to other brand
"I have an S23 ultra, and the back glass is coming off"
"I have a Galaxy S21. 4 Years, no issues. But 1 week ago, the phone started to have mobile network issues. Mobile internet, whether 5G or 4G, is no longer stable, and it often falls back to 3G mode and stays there, which is nearly unusable. Activating and deactivating flight mode will provide around 5 to 15 minutes of 5G connectivity, after which it reverts to 3G. Replacing the SIM card, deleting the network cache, and other solutions only work for up to 15 minutes after it reverts again to 3G. I once had the issue that I was in a parking basement and had no network or internet available to pay for the parking lot, while my wife's iPhone 14 still had 4G available there. She gave me a hotspot to pay for the parking.

The odd thing is that the mobile network provider and several repair shops are telling me that many models of Samsung Galaxy S24 and down have started with these issues for at least one week. And several mobile network providers are affected too."
well i mean that's the only way to force you to upgrade. Btw Samsung expect you to trade in your phone or wearable every year
"Too many adds sold my TV and bought a different brand. Also, Phones are full with stupid games etc. that reinstall itself.

Will be my last Samsung Phone as well. 

Was a user for 20 Years."
"My Galaxy S21 has functioned reliably for four years. However, approximately one week ago, the device began experiencing mobile network connectivity problems. Specifically, the mobile internet connection, regardless of whether it is 5G or 4G, has become unstable, frequently reverting to 3G mode, rendering it nearly unusable. While toggling airplane mode temporarily restores 5G connectivity for approximately 5 to 15 minutes, the issue invariably recurs. Troubleshooting steps, including SIM card replacement and network cache clearing, provide only temporary relief, with the problem reemerging within 15 minutes. Notably, I encountered a situation in a parking garage where I was unable to access a network or internet connection to pay for parking, while my wife's iPhone 14 maintained a 4G signal. She subsequently provided a hotspot for payment.

Interestingly, both my mobile network provider and several repair shops have indicated that numerous Samsung Galaxy models, including the S24 and earlier versions, have exhibited similar network issues within the past week. Furthermore, this issue appears to affect multiple mobile network providers."
"Do you think S25/S26 will be worthwhile? Obviously, S25 has the... camera rings.. but, just curious  
I'm currently coming from an Apple user considering swapping to Samsung's ecosystem solely because of my phone's battery degrading (although only 17%) over 2-3 years, which was pretty frustrating because my battery is only 2018 mAh according to factory spec.

  
Just want to know your opinion because of your experiences with Samsung"
"I was of the same mindset and last year and I bought the new flagship Sony Xperia 1 VI.  On paper it's great; battery lasts a long time, very responsive display, has an SDCard slot, headphone jack and great sound.  But the software left me hanging.  Simple things like weather, gallery, etc simply aren't there.  Also, I have the Samsung watch and some features do not work if you're off-brand.  So, I ended up buying the S25 and I am very happy with it.  Now to sell the Sony! :)"
Same. Getting only 2.5 SOT on my 1 year old S23. They are really hiring very bad engineers right now.
"Have you made sure to have the battery protection option on? Either the one that stops it from charging fully? Or you can use the adaptive one, if you have a pretty steady schedule. It will go up to 100% and then lower down once it gets there. These help keep your battery lasting longer."
"well... the yearly release cycle is killer to providing an environment friendly to new and unique ideas. There isn't enough time and they're already planning 2 or 3 phones ahead, so its not about a fresh idea but how can they make it just a bit better than the year before."
"As a person who is deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem (Mac Mini M4, iPad Pro M4, Apple Pencil, iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch series 10, AirPods, etc.) I want to disagree with you...but I don't think you're wrong. In fact, I think you're dead on correct. Gotta make money somewhere. If not through innovation, then through cost-cutting."
Capitalism isn't alive or capable of thought.
[deleted]
"Noticed this years ago on many different brands in all categories. Everything is made for only a short time or new the following products are just a very little bit better or sometimes even worse performance wise and just better battery or what ever.

I also have to get a new phone at least every 2 years now because especially the battery is a pain (samsung too)"
"Without Capitalism, you wouldn‚Äôt own a smartphone. What a ridiculous mindset."
"I have the S23 Ultra and it was spectacular until the recent update which turned into a hot potato which loses battery quick. I could literally see the battery percentage go down in real time now which never happened before.

The hardware seems ok but their software decisions are terrible They should at least give us options to revert updates."
"I understand your curiosity: I have an S24 FE, bought last December. For my lifestyle I don't need an Ultra, it would be overkill for me. Having said that, I always choose the S series because the difference compared to the A series is definitely noticeable. Previously I had a base model S22, bought in February 2023"
Dude for reals. The galaxy watch 8 series if fugly AF LOL.
"This guy received a Fold 7 with moisture in it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/s/1lLSC4GxYn"
But are there even any other comparable android tablets? I haven't really looked at the market recently but when I got my tab s7+ as well there seemed to not really be any other competition with seemingly only apple the only other premium tablet option but ios is just a deal breaker for my use case.
"So after jumping the Samsung Galaxy S Ultra ship where to go then, please?"
There are apps made by Samsung to eliminate the shutter lag
False phones are unlocked
"Base on my experience there was no region lock on samsung. I bought korean version, hongkong version even china version all network is usable even 5g is working."
"There are some chinese companies that removed hardware band support when selling chinese versions of phones (oneplus and vivo, for example). It's their way to force people to buy global version instead of cheaper chinese variants"
"I am also part of the ecosystem. I've used two watches, first an ActiveWatch, last year I broke it and swapped for a Watch6. In all the time I've had no problems with them. Very interesting situation with headphones, for me samsung has no good headphone models. I can't wear regular wireless headphones, especially in-canal ones. And the only ones that work for me are the Galaxy Buds live. They have a very unconventional shape that I haven't seen anywhere else. They fit me perfectly, and it's a shame that samsung decided not to produce any more headphones of this line;(
I also use galaxy tab with a keyboard instead of a laptop, and for my tasks I have enough power with it. But multitasking can be a problem though."
"I'll gladly give you an opinion: this week I've looked at the world of telephony and I have to admit that, in the Android world, Samsung has the best 'pure' performance, net of questionable CPU choices in the past. The new 25 came out at attractive prices (student discounts + deducted the price of your old phone if you return it at the time of purchase).
Then probably (depending on which country you live in) in September they will have 'back to school' offers and you will be able to buy it at a discount. 
It's a very good phone, I recommend waiting until September to buy it on offer."
"Oh wow I thought mine was bad but this is atrocious. I used to get 7, sometimes 8 hours SoT on the S23, now that number is easily cut in half. I love One UI but not enough to deal with this, so I switched to OnePlus"
"Yeah, someone with a degree could probably put a name to it. Less threat in the market means less changes needed to compete too"
"I‚Äôve been an apple guy for about four years now almost 5. Was android before that and I‚Äôm very tech savvy and comfortable. 

The only new tech that I‚Äôve seen realistically is probably the folding stuff . Sure cameras changed slightly every year but I think there is some consensus that phones from for five years ago took better photos than the ones we‚Äôre getting now. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking technology to make your phone a little bit thinner ordering increase the brightness just a little bit. Those aren‚Äôt real innovations those are adjustments.

Edit-this was voice to text with a few typos"
Not with that attitude it isn‚Äôt
I have the 13 pro lol. And that‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs hard to improve anymore.
"Hmm, sort of. How nuanced or broad are you speaking?"
S22 has the worst processor. Sd 8g1
I like it a lot actually. Its very subjective.
He deleted that thread pretty quickly huh
"I was aiming for Pixel 8 Pro (because ‚ÄúIpHoneS aRe Sh*T‚Äù, other people told me, you know), but as it‚Äôs not available here where I‚Äôm from, I had to wait for a month. Bought 14 Pro Max planing to use it only until Pixel arrives, of course. Long story short, two or three days after I cancelled Pixel order, continuing to use Iphone to this day. The only regret is not trying it earlier instead of reading and listening what other people say.¬†"
"You mean Camera assistant, Expert raw and such ? a) they don‚Äôt really help b) why is there shutter lag in the first place ? All of the competition solved it - can‚Äôt find a device (midrange or flagship) that has worst motion blur"
US/Canada version will not have 5G work out of box in China because China uses band 8 which is supported in hardware but not in software. For it to work one will need to enable it in service menu (*#73#) which works with OneUI 6/8.
"In general on 'is it worth it?': In my opinion spending more than 800 euros on a phone is never worth it, especially considering what you can get for that money with a computer, but maybe coming from Apple you are used to different price ranges. The S25 in my opinion is only worth it when it reaches 800, which will probably happen in September 2025 and February 2026"
Oh right lol üòÇ
"Globally sold with exynos 2200. Trust me, it's much worse"
"Realistically, I think if I buy a Samsung, I will wait until the S26, see the price, and see the reviews. The S25 is a little lukewarm review wise, but that's very insightful! Thank you! 

Again, I would go for the 25, but I'm just a little unhappy with the build quality this year. I know it'll be fixed, though, because I also looked at the Flip's review (JerryRig), and it seems to have fixed the issue with the camera rings being improperly attached

So, you personally think it's worth it ONLY if it's on sale? just clarifying"
"The S25 isn't very revolutionary, it's a great phone, but I would wait for the September offers to get it. The S26 will solve the aesthetic problems of the 25, but it will also be the same as the 25 (which in turn is the same as the S24)

Let me explain better: In my opinion, for 4 years up to today, all high-end phones (S series in Samsung, and iPhones) have reached a level of hardware power (12GB RAM, 512GB storage) much higher than can ever be exploited by their software (in normal use, but also for the majority of phone games), so it no longer makes sense to always buy the latest model. The new models offer very few improvements, often only on paper: the same RAM, the same storage, and essentially the same camera and processor. 
In fact, you are buying the same phone but at double the price (so much so that even aesthetically the various vintages are becoming more and more the same).
So for this reason it makes no sense to me to buy the latest model at double the price of the previous one, and 800 euros is the most I would spend on a phone in 2025"
"I looked at the technical data sheet of the S26 and it would seem that the S25 was created only as an intermediate technology to gradually move from 8GB of RAM to 16GB, so actually in light of this I would say that the 25 is not a good buy. It was probably designed to be weak on purpose, so as to make the generational change felt with the 26th. You are right to wait for the 26th."
yeah. its the s24 but worse (25)
"For the reason you ask who bought the phones for the people.

A05s is almost 2 years old but still supported, has 1080p 90hz LCD. But is slower and worse camera.

A42 5G is nearly 5 years old and probably out of software support which I would think is important for business use. 720P screen which sucks but it's Amoled and brighter. Possibly much faster.

Both are bad options in 2025 I guess it comes down to cost."
the Galaxy A05s is newer
"My secondry mobile is Galaxy A31, but clarity and visual is good"
Thanks !
"Fix: 
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra Now Has One UI 8 Watch *in USA*"
Yep just installed it a few hours ago!
No updates yet in Singapore :(
Yaaaay. I like One UI.
"In Canada, no updates since March."
"Has it, though? On germany, every tech site raged on since yesterday over this cool update. But in germany, you still can not load it. It's frustrating beyond anything."
"There are only two words in this title that aren't a brand or product name.  ""now has"" lmao"
WOW!!!!!!!
"Wait I didn't know the USA has always been their priority. Like, I thought thire top priority should be their domestic market."
I just got the update. The new pill shape UI is so ugly and stupid.
FYI - oneui 8 allowed watch 7 ultras to sign up for visible bundled watch service which was not available previously.
"IDK why the US is always their highest priority, at least it not as bad as the Pixel where they keep them exclusive from the rest of the world, correct me if I'm wrong."
"How's the experience, I've heard lots of good things, but also bad ones, I haven't followed it much since the first versions."
same in UK and Europe
I ran the beta and the only real change I saw was the pill shape.  I think they did this because people had issues with the smaller icon images.
üôÑ here we go again...
They're competing against Apple who has a great share of the US market. In the rest of the world is pretty even
$$$$$
"If they're competing against Apple, why are they always seen as complacent by many in this subreddit?

They'll complain how they're losing marketshare to Apple and the rest of the competition, yet claim that they're not innovative because they're outselling the ""innovative"" brands, that's kinda comfusing."
"Correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't the rest of the world count, everytime i see a post on Reddit criticizing Samsung for not pushing boundaries, they'll always point the US, while here in the EU, there's a huge amount of options, especially from China."

"Kinda funny statement since Samsung copied buds design, lockscreen widgets, watch ultra (both name and design) and titanium idea. I actually recently sold my S23 and went back to iPhone. Those two systems are more and more similar with every update, but the best looking watches are Classic series from Samsung, wish the band was real leather or at least didnt have that silicon underneath. Anyway, glad you are happy and wont miss apple!"
I also made the switch pretty recently. Hope you enjoy your purchases.
"How‚Äôs the battery life on the Galaxy Watch 7? Do you use AOD?

I‚Äôd like to grab a 7 but I‚Äôm worried about battery life. I‚Äôd be ok if it were 2-3 days but <24 hours unacceptable. I‚Äôve tried the PW2 and was not impressed with the battery. However, some other threads I‚Äôve asked in, it seems like improvements have been made and 2 days is pretty routine."
Im on iPhone rn I NEED SAMSUNG üò≠üò≠ IPHONE IS SO SHIT
Bro u went from 1 ecosystem to another‚Ä¶idk how liberated u truly are lmfao
"I agree about the Buds 3 Pro. I love them, but I have issues with the ANC. It's not as good as my Airpod Pro 2s were, and sometimes when I put them in, one earbud's ANC doesn't kick in and I have to reseat them both for it to work. And the game mode sucks for latency; there's noticable audio sync issues when watching videos on my S25 Ultra.

But the fit is great, sound is great, style is great. Also wish they'd turn the tips inward in the case."
What do ya think about the Galaxy Watch? I've never had a smart watch and have been considering it recently.
"One UI is amazing and has lots of perks. I especially love its Samsung pay. Great editing tools. Not a fan of its gallery app though. Widgets and notification management is much superior to iOS. 
But if u still use a MacBook, u will miss the iPhone a lot. Especially when transferring media. Yes, there are numerous workarounds but nothing will feel as seamless as airdrop. Plus some neat tricks really comes in handy in Apple ecosystem like u can use ur iPhone camera as a webcam. Using ur iPhone from macboook. Receiving ur calls on mac. Casting ur phone on to Apple TV. Managing ur messages in MacBook. 
Anyways, enjoy the experience."
"So you went from simping from one brand to simping for another. This isn't a positive change, this is just a change neither for better nor for worse. Do whatever makes you happy and buy the product that suits your needs, but don't act like you some wisecrack for swapping out your corporate overlord for another."

It's funny watching the Apple commercial highlighting New photo editing features that have been on Android for over 3 years...
"I‚Äôm curious about what freedom specifically made you want to switch? I‚Äôve been back and forth over the years but have been quite content with iPhone for the past 5-6 years until recently. iPhone really dropped the ball on AI and that functionality is important to me. Thinking of switching to Samsung or Google simply because of the better Gemini integration. 

That said, I don‚Äôt know what freedom you are talking about. Personally endlessly tweaking the sizes of icons, changing the system font to comic sans, and other cosmetic ‚Äúcustomizations‚Äù really don‚Äôt appeal to me. Even when I used a pixel, I never once did these things. 

The ability to sideload apps, use apps like PDAnet that allow me to make tethering and a few other super techie things are appealing but ultimately not enough for me to bother. I‚Äôm gonna wait to see what Apple announces for the 17 generation before finally jumping ship."

"The AirPods Pro 2 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro both offer approximately 27dB of overall noise cancellation; however, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro demonstrate superior performance in attenuating low-frequency sounds, whereas the AirPods exhibit a marginal advantage in mid-frequency noise cancellation."
Nice.
"Congratulations üéä 


Btw you Galaxy Device will work better if you have more Samsung devices at home like tv, AC, fridge, washing machine, laptop, tab etc...

Other brands will also work if it has ""Matter"" or ""SmartThings"" support"
"Welcome! I have a similar aged 'ecosystem' myself with an S23, buds pro and watch 4 and the ipad air. And i have to say its perfectly fine and usable. One question though,  do you not miss the apple ecosystem?"
Get a MagBak elite case - thank me later
"I recently came over from Pixel and I have to say I think the samsung ui and large feature set are great, but the AI features aren't really close, Pixels have that locked down. 

Samsungs AI is useless at the two main things I used to use it for, proofreading larger body's of text and erasing backgrounds of showroom photos.

Yes the samsung can do both of these, but the content filter on the proofreading is so sensitive that 85% of the time it refuses to help with that generic profanity error.

And all the photo tools leave a watermark, so how good they are doesn't matter, the Pixel tools dont, so they're better by default."
is that an alternative s-pen that works?
Boom! Welcome to the golden age of smartphone experiences.
Welcome to the land of freedom and customization ü§ó
"bro I just did this and I've had this S23U for over two years, and Samsung phones in general for far longer. 

Game changing."
Howw
Isn't the white stripe google wallet?
"White stripe = Samsung pay, right?"
The only thing preventing me from switching to other brands is Goodlock and the new aoftware update life span.
Goodlock should of been auto downloaded to new phones because what do you mean I could of had cat buttons at the bottom all this time?
You can also change its color and opacity
"I have the white stripe on and I feel my full screen experience is absolutely fine... In fact I love it, use it daily and it's one of the very few developments in Android over the past years that I find useful."
"keep in mind that airpods pro 3 are going to release soon, and are probably going to be a lot better than both"

"The home screen can be resized, icons shrunk/expanded, app folders open full screen/windowed, adjustable number of bottom bar apps, widgets can be resized/stacked/reshaped, icons are reskinable/renamable, and more with goodlock.

I've spent far too long poking my phone"
"there is a lot more customization yes, but most of it is gimmicky to be honest. some features are nice, but i found a lot of it to be unnecessary"
"i enjoyed my time with s23+, now shifted to 16 pro."
But the sound quality is better then the air pods
"The most user-binding pieces of that ecosystem are the phone and the watch. Personally I'm using Sony bluetooth earbuds, and the cooperation with the phone and the watch has pretty much always been very good for years. Felt literally zero need for anything else by Samsung."

And size.
"I also use it it's just invisible. You keep all the gestures minus thing that's not adapted for some apps (there's a black line in the bottom of the screen on which the white stripe lies). And even if the line is not black it still takes up some screen space.

Sure.
"Lol, I'm an Android user. But phone wars should only go as far as deciding for yourself which is better for you.

I crave iOS for attention to detail, aesthetics, simplicity, but choose Android for features, customisability, speed of simple actions. Most people just choose Apple because it's stable, very high quality, and doesn't cost that much more than Android long-term, just deal with it that Apple made a better phone for most people, and perhaps even in general, if it wasn't for it's limitations."
"Samsung fanboys are just as sheep as Apple fanboys, maybe even worse sometimes."
"Samsung has pretty much gone the same way the past few years, and Android is becoming more and more of a walled garden. It's becoming an illusion of choice."
"it's just a freaking phone, stop treating it like a cult, let people enjoy things¬†"
"They're comparably good devices.

Both have annoying quirks.

Use other flavours of Android or the Windows phone OS and there are again more quirks.

But Samsung and Apple seem to provide the more well rounded package. (Pun intended with the fastest updates that rounded everything)"
You can do all of that on iPhone‚Ä¶?
Should be top comment on every single fucking post about switching from anything to android.
"My screen got burn-ins after 3 months, replaced it and sold. My favourite phone ever was S9+. I wish they remade that phone with a new snapdragon chip and I would totally insta buy it. Best design ever."
Thanks buddy
Damn thanks for this
"As someone who has had this turned on for OneUI 5, 6 and then again in 7 when they took it away (requiring goodlock), I don't recommend turning it on.

It causes the navigation to lag when waking the phone up from sleep (when the phone is left idle for a while). It'll take 1-2 seconds to show up. Sometimes causing me to scroll down the page instead of swiping to go home.

I leave the bar enabled now and that issue is fixed. Gesture navigation is instantly available when I unlock my phone."
What's the point of hiding a 1mm thick line? Why would someone add an additional module in Goodluck for this? I use other modules but I thought Navstar is for navigation buttons only
Lol u still understood me even though my dumb ass used the wrong name. Yea I thought it was cos on my phone it's samsung wallet
"It's still there, I don't know where'd you get the idea there's none. It's invisible."
"Ah, maybe it's because I have the navigation buttons here, so I just need to hold in the home button instead of holding in the swipe up button"
it‚Äôs true lol‚Ä¶ airpods pro 2 came out almost 3 years ago and are still just as good as the buds 3 pro which came out last year.
Me when I switch my blind loyalty from one ecosystem to the other.
"There definitely are Samsung sheep, no doubt about it. However, if one day Samsung decided to make a whole heap of horrible decisions, Android in general has plenty of options to fall on. It's pretty easy for a Samsung user to jump ship & swim over to another Android. And man, there's a lot of phones that call my name, but I know I'll miss a lot of the Samsung features. Heck, I'd love a Fold or even a Flip, they're wayyy cool, but I know I'd want my Ultra more.


Apple practically forces you to be a sheep if you enter the ecosystem and if you try to leave, you're sinking with a lot of the ship before you can. I mean even just them being FORCED to change to a BETTER port is mind-boggling to me, especially when all their other products already used the better port lol.


If Samsung is a religion, then Apple is a cult. 


(This is coming from someone who has a Samsung phone and also a MacBook. I do enjoy the MacBook, I don't think I will ever own an iPhone)."
"I have to step in here and agree. I speak to Apple, Samsung and other users (Pixel, OnePlus, Moto, etc.). Samsung fans have been worse than the Apple fans. Apple fans can take some ribbing and don't care much. Samsung fans though, come absolutely unglued if point out where Samsung is screwing up. I always say that Samsung could release an actual turd and Samsung fanboys would explain to us 5 different ways how it is actually yummy chocolate and good for us. 
One more reason I am switching to OnePlus this year."
"Strong disagree on that, I still get Apple propaganda jammed down my throat by coworkers too often and I'm not in a typical ""phone"" space that this should come up. It was so much worse 5 years ago and the same before that. I expect it will continue to get better but damn, that statement to me is so wrong."
"They've also established themselves as a reliable feature packed choice. It's not a conspiracy that Apple and Samsung both make the best smartphones in the world. Despite their flaws, no other brand touches them in terms of maximizing all the modern smartphone requirements. I don't want the unforeseen issues with Vivo or Xiaomi, regardless if they have the best cameras or other features, it's the whole package we all want."
Didn't know you could physically resize icons to be bigger/smaller in IOS. Thought you only recently got the ability to make changes to icon skins and change the home screen grid size.
3 months burn in? what phone was it? pretty sure its covered under warranty
"Never noticed such phenomenon, weird."
"The 1mm thick line also has a background and because Goolag loves freedom, making it transparent is an option for devs, and while thats a good thing, it ends up looking bad based on the app cuz its not consistent."
I explained it somewhere in this thread
"It looks slightly different as I can recall, going all the way from the edge of the screen. This one must be a navigation bar"
"Yeah Buds 3 pro goes at half the price of Airpods, so..."
"I disagree about having other options to easily jump to, at least in the US. There is such limited competition here due to the US government keeping actual Asian Android competitors out. Here in the US you pretty much have no real top tier competitors like Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei. OnePlus is coming up, but still has areas it needs to work on. I am personally switching to OnePlus because I want to support a company that innovates and cares about their customers, unlike Samsung that seems to be seeing how much crap they can get fans to buy at the highest price points while putting out bad designs and outdated hardware.

The only thing I will miss about Samsung is the software like Good Lock."
"I dont agree. Samsung fans are rampant in youtube comments arguing we dont need larger batteries, faster charging, or s pen support because ""who cares"" üòÇ. These dudes aren't jumping ship. Theyll take the same abuse they laugh at apple users for enduring. After the z fold 5, trying oneplus really opened my eyes."
"I suppose. Still wondering if I want to stay with Samsung when my S22 Ultra needs replaced. My issue is every smartphone I've ever had has been a Samsung, so it's hard to just use something else."
Brand new S23. Bottom and top bars burned as hell. Screen had been replaced under warranty ofc before I sold it.
Likely because you're using an S25 Ultra. You'll notice it in a few years when Samsung releases worse updates over time for your model.
"Yes, correct, Samsung wallet is ""thicker"" since it goes all the way from the edge. Also, you can **only** see the Samsung wallet bar when you're on your homescreen."
they are the same price‚Ä¶ lol
"I am switching to OnePlus this year and next from Samsung. They seem to want to use newer tech and they seem to listen to customers. If OnePlus added a BT stylus and better cameras to the OnePlus 13, it would be an S series Ultra killer instead of an S series Plus killer. Since I don't care much about the s-pen and think the cameras and pic quality is passable for the OnePlus 13, I am good with it. Especially being able to full charge in 35 min or less and have a 2 day battery cycle. The display is already heads above Samsung too."
"So you're facing the exact same issue an iPhone user would.
When I got my first Samsung - S24 Ultra, mostly using Google phones, upgrading every 2-4 years, since Nexus 4, with one LG and one OnePlus phone in between. I was very pleasantly surprised by the nice set of features, but afterwards very annoyed by the frequent stutters and lags, which reminded me why I was a Google phone user, despite inferior hardware...

All Android phones are overall very similar, what you'll be missing most will be many of the Samsung features they've incorporated over the years."
"OnePlus is where I am going. They have been improving consistently and their hardware mostly blows Samsung out of the water. Oxygen OS is getting better each iteration too. They may not have everything perfect yet, but they are headed in the right direction, where Samsung seems to be headed in the wrong direction for me. OnePlus is also fairly priced and not overpriced like Samsung has become. A lot has bothered me about Samsung and the Watch 8 series design was my final straw. I am sliding completely to OnePlus this year and next. Watch, phone and tablet. About a $2500 sales loss for Samsung from me, and about $1700 in sales for OnePlus."
"Well I've been using it for barely two months, previously I was on s23+, maybe because there was occasional micro stuttering overall I didn't notice."
Don‚Äôt bring facts and logic into this subreddit lol. It never ends well.
Oh yeah....okay XD
"I have the oneplus open and oneplus 13. The oneplus 13 is easily my favorite slab phone . Not only is it beautiful, its snappy and i have 0 issues with it. Ik a lot of people don't care but i love my ir blaster also. I can control the tv whether it's on or off.  I just go through my house controlling things and never have to worry about connecting"
"I've heard good things about OnePlus, almost bought one over this actually. Might have to keep them in mind in the future."
"Yeah right?

https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-airpods/airpods-pro-2

https://amzn.eu/d/5iIL4uW"
"Nice. Thanks for the info, and it is cool they still IR blaster. I just inherited an LG TV with missing remote and have to use my firestick to control it, so IR blaster would be handy. I am waiting for the OnePlus 14 to swap phones, since my S24 Ultra is still fairly new. Probably get OnePlus phone early next year. I am switching watches in November, when all the big deals hit for Veteran's Day and Black Friday. I might swap my Tab S8+ for a OnePlus tablet around the same time. 

I am kinda of excited to get into a whole new environment with a company that wants to compete by using newer tech and providing good customer relations."
"Do not bring in current prices and sales as a representation. They both launched for the same price. The buds 3 pro were plagued by quality control issues, had worse audio quality, worse noise canceling, and a worse fit, and they sold like garbage, so they lowered the price, acknowledging their inferior product.

I like most Samsung devices more than Apple. But you‚Äôre a fool to make this argument."
"your purposefully making the airpods look more expensive. they are the same price on sale (both can often be found on sale) 

i‚Äôm not sure where you live, but the in the usa they are the same price"
Yea id wait too. Its super new. Good on you for waiting for on actual upgrade. Im done the same. Got my last phone otw in. I wont be buying another phone for a few years
"Lol... we base our opinion on current selling prices, not the msrp.

And taking an u turn after seeing the prices is crazy. Cope harder."
"‚ÄúPro Cameras, Optimized for Potability‚Äù

I‚Äôll drink to that! üòÇ"
"You gotta give them one thing, that phone is crazy thin. I really don't see them going much thinner so I wonder what the next 5 years will bring."
exciting to see samsung pushing foldable tech forward. the engineering behind making these things thinner while maintaining durability is pretty impressive. can't wait to see the actual specs
"GOtta need the JerryRigEverything test to see how ""revolutionary"" it is"
I really enjoy reading these technical breakdowns press release on design and material changes for new devices compared to last year.
"Crazy the difference in the UTG thickness, titanium layer, and hinge all work to make a wider opening for the folding portion of the screen."
"Too expensive,  even with trade in of S25 Ultra its $900. I would have bought if it was around $700 with S25 Ultra trade in."
"I don't really see the innovation here.  They're pushing at best with ""mild refinement of previous tech"" -- there's no true breakthrough."
would love to have the foldable with S-Pen. no need to have silo... have it attached outside somewhat like how the palm PDA did.
"I played with it in BestBuy and side by side with the S25 Ultra, and when the Fold is closed, it feels like a normal phone. The outer scree is a hair shorter than the S25 Ultra, but feels good."
"Yeah this. I'm really interested in the pro camera part, tell me more about it. Also, the foldable batteries is pretty impressive. The future looks good."
"Honor, thinner, bigger battery and the most important thing that makes this phone into a media consumption device and the honor for business purposes or useful for a student, the s-pen support that the fold lacks. Oh and it's 0.1mm slimmer too, better cameras too."
Then Jerryrig video comes out and fold 7 snaps in half.
Honor employee of the month putting in the hard work overtime
">0.1mm slimmer too, better cameras too

Check your own subreddit in /r/honor. Everybody knows the measurement is a lie and Fold 7 is thinner. In your own subreddit as well as confirmable in general, Honor's camera is horrible all around unless there is perfect lighting."
"Go to the Samsung flip reddit,I know there's an app that tracks the amount of times you flip and this guy had like 2000 flips in what it seems a year, or more but it was like the flip 3 or 4 and it was starting to become slightly harder to open his phone so he tried reduce the amount of times he opened it.all of those flips wear down the crease too"
"Had the flip5 for about 2 years and was also a bit worried if it will last long enough and also durable enough for my usage. And I have to say after everything it went trough (falling down a few unlucky times before I got a case, falling in water and lots of dust) I never had any serious problems. Also had the flip counter and im numot sure right now but had around 20k flips (but the first 6 months I didn't have the counter so should be something around 25k i guess).

The only thing I noticed in the last months was that it actually got a but harder to open in a uncomfortable way. I guess thats because after this time there is maybe too much dust in the hinge.

Today my flip7 arrived because I wanted the upgrade and also the bigger screen on the outside. And it such an improvement to my flip 5. The phone is a little bigger in general, the screen borders inside and outside are smaller and especially the inside had a bit of a high difference in the corners (probably to protect the screen when closing).

And the biggest improvement which I would never new would be such a change in the whole user experience is the you really don't notice its a foldable phone because the inside screen hasn't any visible or even noticeable gap where its folded. Because that was one of the things i didn't like that much about my flip 5 but it wasn't that much of a problem got very fast used to that and it was only visible if you looked at it from the side.

I would recommend you trying the flip 7 if you want to have a good foldable phone. Its also very nice how small it is when closed. Which is one of the best things about it for me because i not always have pockets where a normal sized phone would fit that easily.

Sorry for the long text but wanted to share my experience :)"
"No one knows, it used to be luck of the draw but they've got better.¬†¬†


These are supposed to be really durable but no one knows until they've owned and used them for 2 or 3 years"
"You don't have to be delicate at all 

My flip 3 did crack, but my dumbass dropped it down a hard staircase 

My flip 5 and fold 6 have been fine 

People well tell you nails leave marks - they don't (maybe if you jam your nail into the screen, but why would you do that) 

Just get one, and get Samsung care or some other phone insurance if you want peace of mind 

They are amazing. I want the flip 7 too, but can justify giving up my gold 6 for it. Next phone will be a flip style again though"
"Switched from a 14 pro max to a flip 5 about 2 and a half years ago and I haven't had any problems besides replacing the factory screen protector (which I easily did myself with the help of Amazon lol)! I've enjoyed my flip so much, I'm going to the fold 7 next! Samsung's customizations is what really sold me <3"
I have the Z Flip 3 and it's still in pristine condition with weekly use. The only issue I've had was the screen protector coming off along the fold about 18 months in. I simply removed it and have been using it without ever since with no issues.
"I love my flip 6 but Ey, look at the difference. Getting my 7 tomorrow, can't wait.. Also, recommend you to get Samsung care+ (it should be included free at least 3 months). Such a relief to the mind having an insurance.

And if you buy it, you should check out some tips and tricks videoes, a lot of stuff you can do.. First thing install multistar so you can get all apps you want on the front screen :)

Enjoy.

"I currently run a Pixel, curious about getting the Flip 7 because I like the unique form factor. Deciding between the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro (TSMC chip, proven form factor, superior photography) vs. the Flip 7 (Cooler form factor, more handy when folded, the Exynos is apparently cool and efficient for normal usage which is most of my use case). 

Will it be a big jump? Do Samsung phones play nice with Pixel watches? Will the adjustment from vanilla android to Samsung UI be rough?"
"As someone who has partnered with Samsung, I can tell you these devices are made with the highest quality and are guaranteed to last you four years or longer.

Any device holds a risk of being damaged, but Samsung devices are tested through every situation.

I especially think you will love the Flip because of its new front screen and how it can pretty much handle most of your quick tasks.

If you do decide on getting one, I wish you the best and hope you enjoy it!"
"I just got rid of the flip 6. I had a case that covered the hinge, never dropped, no damage, never put it in a bag, it rarely left the house. Still had to be repaired twice in 5-6 months under warranty because theirs a single connection between the top and bottom and once
It‚Äôs loose the whole phone crashes including charging. I loved the phone for the size. But it‚Äôs not reliable.

Also because of the narrow screen many mobile apps and websites don‚Äôt work properly because they don‚Äôt scale down small enough. Which makes it tough to use."
I had 3 different Folds and each one bit the dust before I'd had them a year. I won't go back until I see dramatic improvement.
"I wouldn't bet on foldable for over 4 years , there is chance it wont last. If you do end up buying , make sure you have insurance"
"Worth a try. I think it has a good looking and perfect function. This kind of phone is fragile, indeed. But if you are careful, 4 years is ok..."
"Foldable phones are more fragile than the standard layout. The design just introduces more failure points. They look neat but I wouldn't want to own one without some type of insurance on it.


If you live in the USA look into if your credit card company gives you free phone insurance, multiple do. I have Wells Fargo and I need to own the phone and use a prepaid plans and I'm covered up to I think it was $500. Other companies have other terms and conditions, this is just one."
"My flip 6, which I barely used and have not even taken out of the house, suddenly the internal screen just died, went all pink and black randomly. Babied it and never dropped it. There are plenty of cases of this. 

Having said this, I am hoping the new design of the folding  mechanism will prevent this from happening. I played with the demo unit in store and it looks so much nicer."
"If you like it mate then absolutely go for it!!
Fold phones have issues but so does every other device"
"I just recently got my Flip6 to replace the Flip4.¬†


Some things to note:
- Samsung rates their Flip7 screens at 200,000+ open/closes or more than 5 years at 100 opens/closes per day (average)
- Flip7 uses Exynos chip not Snapdragon.¬†
- Flips tend to get HOT and throttle and stop charging. The Exynos runs cooler but reviews still say it overheats on a hot day.
- My flip4 lasted me 2 years and I could tell the screen hadn't been replaced.¬†
- Samsung guarantees 7 years of OS and security patches with 2024 Z and S series phones and newer so as long as the phone doesn't break, it should be supported. Unlike iPhone where Apple doesn't guarantee support for any model."
I'm waiting for my next life
"It will break eventually , crappy camera system , uses the Samsung exynos processor not the snapdragon , meaning some games won‚Äôt be optimised and probably google maps won‚Äôt work properly. Samsung warranty is garbage, other wise go for it!"
"I'll be very honest with you. I bought a flip 4 back when it was released, it went well even though flip 3 and 4 had a lot of issues. I was still using my old iphone as my secondary phone but after a year of using flip 4, I was determined to get the fold 4 and use my flip as my official/ work phone. Since then the fold has died on me multiple times, 2 motherboards have been changed, screens were changed twice all of this while the phone was still in  warranty period. Now it died last week again, same motherboard issue, samsung has denied any responsibility, I am sitting here with a brick that I paid very good money for, while samsung wants to charge me more than 800$ to fix a phone that has documented motherboard issues and isn't really worth 800$. While my flip 4 is still going great, typing this using the flip 4. Take this as you may."
"Honestly, I see it as excessively expensive for the use that is going to be given to it, most of the time on a day-to-day basis I don't think you will use it open, I see it as the S Pen, it is good to have it but I have really used it very very little, at least that is my opinion."
"If you already cant stop thinking about it, then just go for it, or you'll regret it anyway... cause I've been there before. Flip is actually fun to use, just treat it gently"
"If you are doing okay financially, just buy it. Go check samsung flip's sub on reddit so you know exactly what you are looking for."
"I got one from
Rogers. The guy there was like I highly recommend insurance. I honestly feel of returning it. It‚Äôs the return after two years phone so if anything happens I‚Äôm
Screwed"
"Ive been on an Iphone 14 Pro Max for the last 2 years or so and recently got the flip for free through a promotion with ATT. I traded an old flip3 to accomplish this. So I still got to keep my iphone for wifi use at home.

I 100% didnt need to change phones but I figured I would because why not.

Not sure I made the right decision. The iphone feels much more premium and runs much more smoothly. Much nicer screen visually as well.

The battery, despite being 2+ years old also lasts much longer and charges way way way faster. This is really my biggest concern. Battery and charging on this thing is just absolutely unacceptable for me.

Im not a Samsung hater or anything and I bet the flagship non foldable Galaxy phones are similar to flagship iphones, but the way I see it is that if you are on a ""Pro"" Iphone you need to understand that going to a Samsung foldable right now is overall going to be like dropping down a tier of ""premiumness""."
"I love my flip but just know that if something goes wrong with that inner screen, it'll be hell to get a warranty claim on it. My flip 6 has a blotch of dead pixels on the left side of the hinge crease and when I took it in to get repaired, they straight up denied my warranty claim and sent me out of the door because ""dead pixels at the crease are not covered by warranty""."
Did you make the switch? I just place an order. Moving from 12 years of iPhone to Samsung
"Just keep it away fro heat. My cars ac is broken... It was 40 degrees outside. The adhesive near the crease heated up and was less adhesive and became like that. Screen did not crack and physically ne works fine otherwise. but I had a messed up screen protector. This is a Z Flip 5

https://preview.redd.it/eeyp5h2homff1.jpeg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58728cf1272dd6e94b8500ca8864560627f5967c"
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. I really want one but I think I‚Äôll wait a few months to see if it‚Äôs actually worth it. It did just come out this month.
"I own a Z Flip 7 after being with iPhone for quite some time aswell. My Z Flip is great. Just to let you know some things about the phone before you make your decision. Camera isn't the best but it gets the job done. I love that the crease in the middle is now barely noticeable. You will use the outside screen way more than you think you will. It's overall a great phone.




ONE BIG THING TO NOTE!¬†
The battery life isn't the best. It runs out alot faster than my iPhone. I get about 5 hours screen time from it using a mix of high powerd and low powered apps. Most people this is fine but I do use my phone for work so my screen time is usually higher.¬†


Hope this helps üòä¬†"
"To be honest, I was not interested in using foldable phones lately (especially the clamshell one). In last few years, I tried a few and used them for 2-3 weeks and then went back to my regular phone. Reason? They always looked cool but for daily use, they didn‚Äôt feel very practical. The crease on the screen was annoying and the cameras weren‚Äôt good enough to justify the price tag. [Read Full Review](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/gadgets/i-spent-two-weeks-with-the-samsung-galaxy-flip-7-and-it-made-me-love-foldables-again-review-article-152404930)"
"Just switched from iphone to flip 7, been a day. The change will take a bit of time to adapt but overall i am enjoying the phone. The front cam quality is not as good as iphone but i dont take as many selfies as well and if i want to, i can always use back cam which is really nice. Other than that the features are loaded and i really enjoy how AI is integrated into this phone and i dont constantly have to run to chat gpt lol."
"Dont buy the phone, I have used it for less than 10 days, and it appeared the green line issue! It was extremly difficult to contact samsung to get a replacement, I am not sure I will get the replacement neither!¬†
The phone is very fragile. Switching from iphone to this is a terrible idea! Dont do that!!!"
"Personally I'd say it's not worth the money but these things are subjective!  I bought one and regret it - it's too small, even open and in my mind is just a gimmick/like a toy that people will tire of over a short amount of time - for me that's only a few days and I hate it - I much prefer the Fold but this is from a, not too young (or too old) female who does like her tech!  I think the Flip is probably aimed at the younger market which I don't fall in to so silly me!!"
"After 6 months the screen protector is going to start to peel off. Unfolding your phone every time you want to use it can get old pretty quick. Flip 7 comes with a exynos processor which I would avoid at all costs, at least for now where we don't have any benchmarks."
"I‚Äôve been using the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for a while now after trading in my iPhone 13, and while it definitely has some cool features, there are important things you should know before buying a Samsung Flip Phone.

Pros:

Compact & Sleek Design: The main reason I bought this phone it folds neatly and is super pocket-friendly.

Back Camera Selfies: Using the rear camera for selfies via the cover screen is a great feature and produces high-quality shots.

Decent Performance: Smooth experience overall for daily tasks, apps, and multitasking.

Flex Mode Features: Handy for video calls, tripod-style photography, and watching videos without a stand.

The Bad (And There‚Äôs Quite a Bit):

1. Fragility:
This phone is extremely fragile. Even with cases that cover both the back sides, a fall, especially on the folded edge can be fatal. The hinge and inner screen are vulnerable, but there are cases that protect them, but its bulky and ruins the overall look and feel of the phone.

2. Screen Protector Issues:
The pre-installed inner screen protector started showing large bubbles in the middle just 6 months in. It‚Äôs a known issue.

If you don‚Äôt replace it in time, the screen itself can crack.

My friend removed the screen protector after it came off on his Z Flip 5, and the screen broke the very next day, the replacement cost: INR 24,000 (USD 280).

The screen protector itself is expensive. I was quoted INR 1,600 (USD 20), and after a long argument with Samsung reps, they reduced it to INR 600 (USD 7).

Final Verdict:

If you‚Äôre considering the Galaxy Z Flip 7, only buy it if you‚Äôre fully prepared to baby the phone.
It‚Äôs a premium product with a unique form factor, but the joy of the compact design fades quickly when you start worrying about screen bubbles, hinge falls, and pricey repairs.

I personally regret getting the Flip and would‚Äôve been much happier with a Galaxy S24 or even waiting for the S25. The Flip Phones are great for style, but not for peace of mind in my opinion."
It‚Äôs will last until an update bricks it a couple months after warranty ends. Samsungs favorite trick
"I still hold that folding and flipping is not for phones. I'm really sensitive to my device and any slight discomfort could distress me a lot. So from my prospective, I don't recommend anyone to use flip/fold phones."
"I honestly had the flip 3 for probably 4 years now and have no major issues now. I did replace the screen protector a couple of times myself, but other than that, no issues. It's withstood big falls and abuse, and it's still running strong. The only thing now is im running out of space, and the battery is finally taking a dip given the age. It's been pretty reliable other than that. I really like flip 3 and am looking forward to the samsung flip 7 when it arrives. Hope this helps if someone is on the fence about a samsung flipable phone."
Would you be comfortable putting it in your pocket together with some keys or any other metal objects? I'm worried about the external screen getting lots of scratches but I wanna know its durability.
How did you get it so early?
"What's this folder you mentioned?
It keeps track of how many times you open and close it? If so link please. Ty. My flip 7 comes in next week. Traded my flip 6. No problems ever"
This is why I am never buying a foldable phone for now... with their prices it should atleast last me for 5 years.. if it was an A series price then I might consider it for sure.
Nails definitely leave marks on the inner screen. The entire upper left hand corner of my screen is scratched up from whenever my nail made contact w the screen when using on-screen analog sticks in mobile games
I have the z flip 3 too and its been a solid phone. Same issue with the screen protector but otherwise no real issues.
"I have all of these same questions. Did you end up getting one? Currently running a Pixel 8 Pro and a Pixel Watch 2, but the flip 7 is very enticing. I'm just worried about missing the pixel features like call screen etc."
Have had two Flips....never had any issues whatsoever.
"Flip and Fold 100% require insurance protection. 

My Fold 5 Inner screen had the plastic screen coming off and nobody even wanted to touch it, Not even the ubreakifix authorized stores.  

I ended up trading it in for $600 credit towards an S25 base model.

Went with base model because it was practically paid off after the trade in and although a huge downgrade it is much safer to have with me while doing my labor job compared to the sensitive fold/flip phones."
"No, I didn‚Äôt. 
All the comments made me 50/50. Everyone says to be delicate which can be an issue because I am a heavy user..
I‚Äôll probably think maybe next year, or go for ultra.."
"Just straight bullshit

Source - had 3 foldables, only issue was 100% my own fault.

The SoC will be fine too, I gaurntees nobody can tell the difference day to do, phone are so overpowered at this point that it doesn't actually matter"
"I have had the Flip 6 for over a year, using daily, even while working baseball games, dropped several times.  Babying is not necessary."
I have been using Samsungs for 20 years and I have never had this happen. Could be user error?
Im pretty sure its not a problem but im a very careful person in general so i try to do everything to avoid it getting any scratches or something. But its not impossible if your moving much. I want to get a case soon but haven't found one that looks good to me
Front screen is the same glass as a regular non foldable phone screen. So it would be the same as putting your regular phone in your pocket without some sort of cover.
Was also surprised how early it arrived. Just pre ordered after samsung unpacked and it said i will get it on 22th because thats the day it comes to stores. But yesterday morning it already was delivered. Im in Austria maybe its different here but i don't know
"Had to search a bit to find where i even got it myself because i just heard about that randomly on reddit after i got my flip 5. I think thats the site i got it from: https://apkpure.com/z3-flip-counter/com.camg.z3flipcounter

You have to do a few little things with samsung routines to set it up and then it will count your flips. Its a very simple app that just shows today and total number

Edit: forgot to mention that its called flip3 counter but it works with every flip since then (maybe even below but im not sure guess it just needs the routines function from samsung to work) had it on my flip5 too and now on the 7 and works fine"
[deleted]
"Yes, I feel like if they warranted the screen for 2-3 years, and I didn't see all the horror stories of them not accepting warranties even in the first year, I'd be a lot more likely to get one.


I can't afford to replace a phone every time a screen breaks, and I can't count on a fold phone being robust.


But more than anything, it's the cameras. Phones come and go; those pictures the phone takes stay for a lifetime, especially the ones of my kid who is growing up so fast. I'll buy whatever phone takes the best pictures (which right now seems to be the S Ultra)."
Decided on getting one anyway. Let's see how it goes.
Lucky and I'm a little jealous. Let us know how you like it.
"Me too.
I was an android user since 2011 and was fascinated with ios, been using iPhone 15 pm for the last 6 months, while there aren't major issues or complaints that I have, I just like and prefer android more.
I thought I'll use this for 3 more years and get the flip 10 when it comes out.
Has to become more durable, better batteries, better cameras and better hinge, hopefully."
Well now I'm even more tempted hahah
"So far its very nice. Feels good, especially compared to my flip 5. Love that its pretty much not noticeable that ts foldable. Slightly bigger screen (think its just not that narrow anymore which was a bit annoying). Camera is also very good sure not as good as from S25 but thats not a big point for me.

Overall im very happy."
Initial impressions are pretty good
"Awesome, thanks for sharing and happy to hear. I briefly went to the store to look at it in person this weekend since mine should be coming soon. My only regret is I went with black instead of the shadow blue but i figured I'll probably put a case on it any way. From my brief handling of the phone in the store it felt like light years ahead from my flip 3 lol rightfully so. I liked the way it felt opening and closing and liked the bigger cover screen."
The bigger cover screen is really nice. Feels so much better and also more useful now to actually use that for replaying to massages or checking mails. Didn't know how much potential we lost with the smaller screen of my flip 5. I just love it
Thats awesome to hear. Pretty neat how you don't have to open the phone to reply to text if you don't want to. Just curious if you can run other apps like Netflix and YouTube on the cover screen? I heard you have to download an app but people heard people complain saying it didn't work that great. Not sure how true that is.
Hows texting on the cover screen? Actually viable or more of a gimmick?
"You should be able to run every app on the cover screen as far is i know. You just need to to install goodlock from samsung store and in there download lockstar. With that you can add the apps you want to be on the cover screen and this will be on the slide menu on it just like you have alarm, weather etc.

There are good tutorials on youtube too if you need that."
Its a bit different but if you get used to it its very useful. Only problem is that some apps are a bit annoying to use because obviously they were made for a bigger screen. But the flip 7 now has a button to change the ratio of the apps which makes it way less painful xD
"Awesome, thats great to hear.  I'll keep you posted when I finally get mine. It should be here any day now."
Ya im mostly hoping to use it for quick responses etc to save battery
"I understand the frustrations, it happened to me too and with like 3,000 photos/videos with many being sentimental. 

The best thing I can advise is to backup your photos/videos by connecting the old phone to a PC and dragging and dropping the DCIM/Pictures/Movies folder from your phone to the PC. That way you preserve the metadata and can have it on a PC/USB/new phone/etc.

The Smart Switch backup stuff always changes my metadata up so I do it the manual way now at least for media with dates I need preserved."
"Whatsapp is shit, you can't expect it to work properly. Smart switch will work properly, or you can just back it up via Samsung cloud, as it should be backed up anyways."
"Yeah tbh this is a really nig drawback on android/Samsung and one of the few things apple just nails. I'm still completely happy with my Samsung, dont get me wrong but this problem is there since years.
I just disabled time stamps all along so that I'm not frustrated when changing phones ^^ Need to relate to my memory brain now..."
I use coolmuster  to back up  my phone now smart switch was a hit or miss for me
This happened to me and my solution was drag the photos and videos onto the phone instead of using smart switch and it seemed to work fine.
"This is not for everybody, but I use Foldersync for my backups. I have an SSH server running on my PC, so my files get backed up to there, and when I switch phones I just reverse the direction and all the files go into the phone the same way they were. I have never used a switching feature nor want to, seeing how both whatsapp and google absolutely suck at transferring your stuff I'd rather do it myself.


On the other hand, if your files got their modified date screwed up you can use Quickpick gallery mod to fix them, as long as they still have the metadata in them, which isn't the case for whatsapp pictures"
"Yeah, what retard decided NOT including an SD card slot so data transfers could no longer be done simultaneously with the SIM card was an UPgrade? üôÑ"
That's messed up it changes the metadata
I guess that explains why my sucky 3 years old exynos s21 ultra still has 80% battery health.
My s20 fe 5g still has 93% battery health after 4+ years and 1559 cycles. But i'm also carefull with my phones.
"This is based on the manufacturer claims, the EU hasn't actually tested every phone"
"So you're telling me the company that makes the world's worst appliances also makes the world's best phones? Unexpected, but good on them!"
Prob fsct my iPhones never last long
true...but for the balance they get green lines
"I've had an S10 and an S21 for more than 2 years each, I gave them to family and friends and their batteries are still holding up great."
"I don't actually believe it. I've had to have the battery replaced in every Samsung phone I ever owned, they don't last much longer than (if), two years. The last 3 Android phones that I've owned all succumbed to ""moisture"" problems and couldn't charge the traditional way, wireless only.¬†"
My fold 6 battery is down 10% after about 250 cycles. Even with battery protection.
"Nah, bullshit. My shit s22 would need to be charged like 4 times a day. Had drop 65% during a 2 hour lunch with moderate use."
"Is this actually an overall-performance label or a lab-tested one?

IOS will still be the better optimized OS, and up to this point, iPhone batteries still last longer than Samsung's, so It's not obvious what the practical reach of this label could be."
"if its a great feature then why samsung does not advertise it though? ü§∑ someone already spreading ""fake"" news about SiC being much worse on cycles than the samsung battery LOL. its like they want us to ""STAY"" on li-ion/poly forever so that we can still change phones every 2years ü§£üòÅ. i really commend the CHINESE battery factories and phone brands for pushing SiC chemistry. its been so long the  Battery tech on phones is so left behind it cant keep up on the power usage of SOC and Display."
I didn‚Äôt see the iPhone mentioned?
In my experience the main problem with my samsungs (I have zero experience with other competitors) is not the battery but the performance suffering after 1-2 years. I always reach this point where every single thing you do takes an awful amount of time because it reacts so slowly. I had an A50 and A32. In both cases the battery was mostly fine but I ultimately switched to the next phone due to cracked screens and the performance
"Meanwhile, twice as likely for the battery to explode."
"Still lag behind Chinese flagships with silicon-carbon batteries that offere bigger batteries and have more life cycles.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Vivo/s/ezfuCRPKfg

I sold my x100 ultra after a year with 98% battery health 
. 

Perspective is important"
Compare it against SiC batteries. Comparing against older tech is meaningless.
"80% after 3 years is the case for every other company, there is nothing incredible about that , I would even say it's a bit lower than normal considering my Oneplus I had lost 3-4% in a year ."
This is very normal lol
Battery health is an inaccurate meaningless measurement.
How to check battery health in android?
"The entire legislation would be retarded and pointless if they blindly trusted manufacturers. The EU demands third party verification.  
I clearly remember Apple bitching about those labs - how their findings don't align with Apple's tests, how they're dropping the phone wrong... something in that direction, the usual"
I tested a few and the claims hold up.
Says a person with S22 Ultra üôà
I guess so yeah it's confusing
"I've only ever gotten green lines by dropping phones. No amount of update and rom flashing will ever do that. So when you see green lines on someone's phone, you how that they're definitely ""a dropper"". You get to see people on the internet revealing their careless nature to the entire world without even having to ask first."
My old S9+ and S8+ both went to shit in 2 years. My iPhone 7 Plus went down in 2 years aswell. If you ask me only Chinese phones last long.
I can believe it. My son was using my old S9 for over a year before we finally upgraded him to the S25 just this past April. That S9 was bought in 2019 and he used it all through 2024 still getting at least a day out of it. That was all he needed.
Meanwhile all the haters say SiC gets only 300 cycles. Chinese manufacturers aren't using first generation SiC from 2000. I also like that Samsung lies about using lithium ion when they clearly use lithium polymer.
lol that's a good one üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is due to a being a midrange phone. You‚Äôd be hard to find a suitable alternative for those price points.
apple does this too.
When my old S8+ have destroyed itself because of early OLED. I actidently puntured the battery and it didn't explode. Can confirm their batteries are twice as less likely to explode.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Si-c batteries degrade faster than Li-ion?"
"Si-C batteries have higher capacity, but are known for worse longevity."
SiC is much worse in this regard
how to check it .?
"My Xiaomi still at 84% after 4.5 years, easy 8h SOT."
"It also depends on personal usage and charging. If you let it go from 100 to 0 everyday then the battery will degrade fast, but if you never let it die and never fully charge, it will last. Same with fast charging, used a 45w charger on my s23 ultra and it would get fairly warm and I'm sure it was cooking the battery¬†"
"2 year old s23 ultra, 95%"
"My friend with a 1 year old 15 pro max already down below 80%. Considering I use my phone a lot and the constant overheating because of the exynos, i think the battery is faring better than expectation."
Third party app like Accubattery.
"This is one of the rare instances when I agree with Apple. However the EU is getting the numbers, it's all back-to-front. For example, Oppo and Xiaomi flagships are getting 1000 cycle ratings, but in practice they consistently last 1600 cycles before hitting 80%. On the other hand, iPhones are also rated for 1000 cycles, while typically only lasting 500 to 800."
"They don‚Äôt require any verification without complaints. Yes, it‚Äôs up to the manufacturers to provide accurate info and they can get in trouble if they get in the situation where EU checks on them. But it‚Äôs not a standard procedure.
There are many regulations like this for home appliances for example, in my experience they don‚Äôt tell the truth all the time."
The s22 series (especially exynos) has a notoriously horrible battery life. I should know because I switched to s23 as soon as it is out.
bro i never dropped my phone in past 2 yrs still i got this shitty green line on this shutty ass brand phone...samsung is shitt now...cant trust it anymore
"If you take reasonably good care of your equipment, your equipment will take care of you. If you use a case, a tempered glass and charge your device 20%-80%, it will last for many years."
"The older phones weren't as bad, back when they weren't ceramic. You used to be able to pop a battery out and pop another one back in super easy. S10 is when they started making them out of this un-openable nonsense ü§£.


I still have my S3 kicking around, still works. Just needs a new battery üòÖ.¬†"
"Chinese manufacturers don't use 2000s old SiC. They use new gen from 2020s. Vivo have even combined semi solid state tech with SiC, so they less likely to explode and catch fire."
[deleted]
"Depends on your phone , some have battery health stats and others don't but there is an app called accubattery which can show approximately the battery health ."
May I know what Xiaomi series you used?
"I can say for sure fast charging, 100% to 0 and overnight charging reap havoc with a battery. I have had a Tab S8 for 3 years. Set it to 80% charge, dim screen slightly, cut resolution down, only charge in day time, and few other tweaks. I use it 12 to 14 hours a day. Last night it droped 2% in 9 hours"
"Bruh, overheating with exynos is 100% fact. Speak as an A54 owner."
"
Apple is ass no big news"
 Better use Plus Plus Battery from f droid.
"2056 cycles 84% from my Xiaomi, can confirm Xiaomi is getting well over the ratings."
"Legislation says market surveillance is a mix of active (planned) checks, reactive (complaint based) checks and some kind of joint campaigns across states."
My S22 is totally fine. I got it at launch in 2022.
I had my 22U for over 3 years and the battery was still great when I upgraded my phone last week.
dropper spotted. I know this from tiktok..pretty much all greenline issues are from droppers. i know some of them irl too. they all drop their phones
"I charge my phone every other day 35 hours later usually 10% to 98%, take it off before hitting 100% as I just can't wait for it, 40 minutes charging the phone is just too long to wait when you have a life. 2056 cycles 84%, Xiaomis are awesome. I hope next year with SiC I will be able to charge every 3 days as new Chinese phones get 12-15h SOT, maybe next year 17h and I also hope for 80-120w charging."
You can't backup anything with the company's marketing material.
And you post a link to the x5 pro which does NOT have a si/c battery. Lol
I use an a53 but mine doesn't overheat
They changed their battery chemistry after 13th Gen because those batteries were lasting too long. The new ones have lower cycle times.
"https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/s/xLcs4HZQVW

Mine had less than 5 hours of battery life for less than 2.5 screen on time"
"Fast charge as a routine is not a good idea. And your don't have to charge it every other day, charge in every day for a shorter amount of time.
Of course each user is different. I charge mine every day on a slow wireless charger by leaving it there when I don't use it."
"Makes no sense, I just sold my 14 Pro Max 256 with 92% of battery, and I had it since launch. 

Got myself 15 Pro as 14PM was too large."
"I have had battery protection on at all times. Easier since I work from home.

I understand that the base model was never amazing for SoT due to the small battery."
"Of course it does degrade the battery span, but would you really keep your phone for past 5 years. I'm upgrading next year and honestly after 5 years 8 Elite 2 will give me a huge speed boost. It's the tablets that need slow charging and the best charging habits as replacing tablets is a waste. Ever since I purchased a GaN charger I've been fast charging every time, never gets past 40c and with SiC the heat tolerance is a bit higher not 45c but more like 47c something mild, so fast charging becomes less of a battery span drain."
Really is the luck of the draw. Bought a 14 Pro used like 9 months after it came out. Wouldn't hold a charge.
Which is every piece of technology ever tbh. There‚Äôs only so much QA can do.

"Samsung, fire the whole watch department and hire this guy. Thanks."
"That would affect the touch bezel experience, not sure if samsung would go with that. Although, in my experience, i rarely use the touch bezel, so they may forgo it entirely.

Also, samsung may not want to reconfigure manufacturing for that kind of cut.

Etc etc"
"Okay I see many people like this design.

I disagree. I feel like circles are just better. They're not practical for a screen, but they're elegant and resemble a real watch. That shape is just... what is that? Samsung icon shape but now a watch?

Edit: now that I think of it, it actually isn't that bad and all. I just, imho I don't like it."
I hope it's true. It looks good.
Square it a little bit more and you get... an Apple Watch ü§î
"I hope it will be like that, I really like it"
"Wear OS only allows for circular displays currently, so the screen shape wouldn't work. The Pixel watch 4 renders all show a circle display, so Google isn't likely to add support for other shapes. 
Either way, I hate the squircle design, so it is irrelevant to me, if they stick to this styling. I am likely moving to OnePlus watch at end of the year or maybe even Pixel 4, depending on specs."
"the whole point of the extra edges is to protect the screen, this would literally reverse that"
Samsung needs to establish a firm design identity with it's watches. I kinda like that design if it happens.
The first one really looks good imo :)
I prefer they have both. Like give people who like circle design the circle and square for people who like squares. Not that anything is wrong with people being squares...cause it's hip to be square...I will show myself out.
"Circle design better, imho."
Oooh I like this
It is the second one with round and squarish corners!
"Ok. That actually looks good.


But I feels Samsung will just do a pill shape instead¬†"
This looks way better than the current design. Making that glass might be difficult.
"love this look, extremely austere..."
I would love a squircle screen.
It actually looks pretty damn nice
Maybe for the 10 not the 9
Rather just stick with the circle but this is better than the 8.
Looks like OneUI icons not bad ngl
Slick. I'd wear it.
Not going to happen. Wear OS is built around round watch designs. Im sure Samsung would do this if they could but currently too much work.
"For me, the ultra looks fine but the watch 8 and classic look off."
The first one looks amazing. It's exactly how I like my smart watch to be. OP it really is Samsung's loss to not have you working for them.
"I see so many designs wether it's cars, electronics etc that are done by just random people look so much better then the people who are actually in charge"
Ugly ass watches
Idk why they didn't go with this design in the first place!?!?

You have no idea how much of this bullshit I believed in the mid 2000s. Anyone else remember Super Sayain 10 with 10 meters of hair lol
maybe they'll try something like the OG ticwatch
Circle is definitely better. This is just better than having a circle and a squircle on the same watch.

Not a big fan of it to be honest...
"Seriously who are these ""consumers""?

Are these the same ones who didn't want Bluetooth in S Pen?"
"Ive said it since the original ad, but Samsung Sam really should be the face of samsungs virtual assistant. They own the rights to the model, people like it, and with AI festures being expanded people want it to be more personalized and functional."
Nah. Stop trying to gaslight us into liking AI because some big companies made some bad investments.
Useless crap.
The only good Ai feature is the object eraser
Who is using mobile AI? Everyone i know shut off as much of it as possible. Its fun to play with for 10 minutes. Thats about it. Is it the same Muppets that wanted rounded corner iPhone clones?
Just wait till they require a subscription to use most of those AI features
Samsung certainly seem to be doing best with al
"Honestly, I do use circle to search a lot more than I initially thought I would. But it's pretty much the only AI tool that I use. And maybe occasionally photo assist, but definitely not a must."
"I don't have an increase of alliance but shareholders could easily be convinced I do just because leave immersed this AI stuff into basic operations so strong. 

hell a third of the ram on the flagship phones from Samsung... are completely reserved for AI functions 

which means your s25 ultra and z-fold 7 effectively have 8 gigabytes of RAM for non AI 

which means you had more RAM in a z-fold one or a note 10 plus ..."
"Such a bs article, using ""AI"" as a word that encompasses everything is just marketing.

People use lenguage models a lot. No one uses on-device AI features, not beyond erasing things on photos."
"Galaxy AI features can be useful once you try them out.

* Circle to Search - for easily identifying items or music.
* Live Translate - useful if you travel around the globe and need an onboard translator.
* Photo Assist - great in editing photos for contents and graphics designing
* Chat Assist - for checking grammar, translations and suggestions on alternative ways in stating your ideas.
* Note Assist - excellent on summarizing articles and taking down notes, translating and summarizing audio to to notes.
* Now Bar/Now Brief - simple way to get up to date on your activities and wants for the day."
What does AI phone even mean? Aren't their AI functions pretty much software based? I recall someone was able to use the object eraser function by sideloading the photo editor apk onto his A-series device.
It doesn't support my language right now. So it's useless to me. When are they gonna add more languages ?
"Idk what's the nonsense the comments are on about . Idk if you guys are dated or what but people definitely use AI on mobile, I thought I wouldn't but it's very helpful, way better than doing an actually Google search and can keep up with the topic you're having to get more info."
[deleted]
Yes!¬† They had to remove the S Pen charging electronics to make room for the AI.
The AI seems to be tied into features that aren't obviously AI dependant so people are engaging without choosing to.
"I use it quite often for editing photos or generative stuff but that's about it phones aways been a decent proofreader with Gboard. Still wouldn't trade the spen for it though, especially when phones as old as the S10 could do most of this stuff without Galaxy ai"
"I know the question is a bit sarcastic, but most likely yes. The average consumer doesn't care about S Pen features and thus is not impacted by the removal of Bluetooth. The average consumer is adopting these AI features. 

The average consumer does not comment in Samsung reddit threads or cares about what the community thinks is good design or value."
Chatbot feature most likely. Instead of searching just ask the AI you get a summary don't have to read the source page that's drawn out for ad placements.  The main thing I use it for.  Cooking or need a recipe just ask it.
the circle to search thing is the only AI i use. sometimes i use object earser but that was available before AI.
Uhm... Me? I use these Galaxy AI features most of the time. It's so convenient and useful for me.
"Get over the s pen , most ppl didn't use it, of course more people will use AI , it's def helpful"
Circle to search is pretty great to.¬†
"Sadly AI is getting very popular. More and more people are using it for things like translation, getting summaries on topics, editing messages, etc‚Ä¶ If AI can do it people are starting to use it.¬†"
Out of touch gang . AI is popular
They already said there no planning on it anymore. Of course I expect them to perhaps rebrand it or come out with something better.
Circle to search is amazing. It is one of the best uses of AI I‚Äôve found.¬†
"You can't? Go into settings, ""Now Bar"", and there is an option to disable ""Daily Briefs"". Doesn't that do it? I've never actually tried."
"The AI summaries are comically inaccurate according to pretty much all quantitative data that studies. this is being pushed way ahead of any reasonable pace for the user because it's beneficial to shareholders and big tech. 

Good example is Gemini which to date can't even play a song from your phone while it's in your pocket. can't use your earbuds to request a song you have to go into your pocket and unlock it. 

arguably the single most important thing for assistant in my opinion has now been broken. I work 2 years into this Gemini as the default assistant."
I honestly didn't know anyone used it until now lol
That's not specific to Samsung. Thats a google thing.
Which features
"According to surveys,  it's not very popular at all. The early 20s and teens want it, it's gaining some traction. Almost 90% of people say they won't pay anything for it if any of it is behind a pay wall, and 80% won't upgrade to get it. You dont need it on a phone. If you want it for search results,  Google already built Gemini into their search engine and Google Photo. Samsung's editing software is sufficient for a cellphone,  anything beyond, and you would just edit on a PC with legit editing software like Adobe. 

Both Samsung and Google translate will already do rapid translation. They won't live translate,  which is will give in to is great, since I spend a lot of time in the Dominican. But I survived without it before. 

They are focusing too heavily on the software and not the hardware like Apple, and its ruining their phones. Tiny improvements are not enough to get people to buy a new phone or watch. The 25 us the first time i didn't get the brand new phone on launch day. Judging by this forum,  I am not alone. The s25 is doing great in Samsung's home territory,  but not as good everywhere else. There used to be literal lines at the store and back orders. I absolutely love Samsung,  I just want to see them start innovating on things that actually matter. Not gimmicks. We shall see what the S26 brings."
They were going to after 1 year but they have now said that they are going to do more development before charging. I suspect they will have a free limited version and a premium one.
"It is not sustainable in the long term. The local AI models are not powerful enough for some of the tasks. At some point, there will be a subscription. 


They just need to get people used to it, in this way, they will be more willing to pay for the subscription."
"No way they invest this much money into something and not charge. Within 1-2 years, it will be subscription based. Guaranteed."
"yep, but thats the only AI i use in my phone."
"AI translate mostly because I travel a lot. Browsing assist, transcript assist, writing assist, and audio eraser."
Apple is about to invent foldable phones!
"> 5.5-inch cover screen

Close enough welcome back iPhone Mini!"
"iOS never adjusted to proper app spacing with the larger devices as far as I'm concerned. Always felt like it was meant for smaller devices. Now we introduce a foldable, I sure hope they allow grid layout changes."
This is good for foldables because with apple foldables  should get more popular.
I'm so happy for Apple to start making foldables. It's going to open the market a lot more. And now Samsung actually has competition.
"I've been dying for Apple to enter the foldable space. Despite the Pixel Fold and the OnePlus Open, Samsung doesn't really have any competition in the US like some Asian countries that gets the Chinese foldables. If Apple enters the fray, maybe Samsung will start trying for the first time since 2020."
"I wonder what word Apple will use to replace ""folding"" or ""foldable"" for marketing purposes."
"if u feel u are missing out on all the changes, just go for a samsung"
"We are optimistic about Apple's potential entry into the foldable market, as it is anticipated to stimulate further market expansion. This development is also expected to intensify the competitive landscape, particularly for Samsung."
"Knowing their design, im already not interested. A nitpick i have about the pixel is how the right corners are rounded and the left are square but the screen is still round so theres just empty blank space in between. I know its petty but it really annoys me. But hey more competition is good."
I wonder what they're going to call it instead of a 'fold'
I hope they make a flip version. I‚Äôm on iPhone 13 Pro so have zero reason to change phones unless it‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm currently obsessed with the Z Flip 6 and 7FE
I refuse to believe apple would implement those plastic screens
"Our phone's screen is not foldable, it's bending. So it's a new thing."
And they will still say that this is a great innovation.
"To be fair Samsung's ""creaseless"" display is straight taken from Huawei and Oppo so..."
[deleted]
This is what I‚Äôm most stoked about!
"Thing is, Samsung already set the price ridiculously high, and Apple isn‚Äôt one to be undercut (on setting stupid high prices)"
"pray it isn't a questionable foldable design choice (e.g. phasing out fingerprints for face-id, opting for bigger notches, or a dedicated camera button)"
"They already have, chinese foldables are great. They are just not available in US market"
iFold
iPhold
"Not even Apple has the money required money to break physics. 

Samsung Display has the best stuff. If they want foldable, that‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got.

It‚Äôs inevitable. The 20th anniversary is coming up."
"""Samsung Display is a major supplier of OLED panels for iPhones, particularly for the higher-end Pro models. While Apple also sources screens from other manufacturers like LG Display and BOE, Samsung's production capacity and technology often make them the primary supplier for certain iPhone generations.""

Uh, yeah. I could see Apple continuing to source screens from Samsung."
90% of apple users i see use cheap plastic screen protectors and those god awful chinese plastic or silicone covers. I cant see why they would be bothered
"Apple

The screen benders.

Apple actually invented the first folding phone with iphone 6 series. Just good luck with folding it back
"NFC, wireless charging, apple pay, apple watch, air drop, swipe keyboard, AI (lol) and a bunch more I can't think of at the moment. They do a great job, most of the time anyways, but the marketing is always hilarious because they're about 4 years late when they finally add them."
"I remember a big hoopla about panoramic pictures, a feature I didn't realize was a big deal and I'd been using basically since getting my sIII."
"This almost seems like satire. What are you talking about?¬†


Apple didn't invent true wireless earbuds,MP3 players, touch screen tablets, touch screen smartphones....


They didn't invent any of those and yet get credit for inventing them all the time.¬†¬†"
Gesture controls stolen from BB10 OS.
Literally came here for this! Give me the mini pro damnit!
Tbf the phone is insanely high quality. It is pricey definitely but oooh that screen is just tempting
Exactly. No US competition. Motorola still has the best flip phone and they are making Samsung up their game.
Chinese phones that fold don‚Äôt compare to Apple ones
Yeah ok. But Samsung ones are like the nintendo ds touch screens. They scratch with your fingernails. That‚Äôs even worse than a solid plastic screen
I saw someone try to say that thunderbolt was actually a proprietary Apple port. Because they had heard the term lightning and just assumed it must have been Apple. Now of course Apple was part of the coalition that created thunderbolt but that's what Apple loves to do.... Take universal standards and turn it into proprietary slop
"You forgot USB-C - and larger screen sizes!

[deleted]
"‚ÄúInsanely high quality‚Äù and ‚Äúcan barely see the crease in the right light‚Äù don‚Äôt seem like they should coincide. 

From my understanding, the price has to do with the extra processors needed to maintain two screens. Granted I‚Äôm software not hardware, but I don‚Äôt fully understand this as there were reports MacBooks were using iPhone chips"
Huawei is excellent too with their foldable models
Fold 7 is the best and is not Apple
That's only the screen protector. You can change it if it gets too scratched. The screen underneath still scratches but at least you have a protective layer. Iphones also will have this screen. You cant change the laws of physics sadly
"Apple and intel co-developed Thunderbolt. They didn't remotely take a universal standard and ""turn it into proprietary, slop."" They literally did the opposite, created an excellent proprietary solution and the opened it up to a universal standard with USB 4 onwards adopting design elements."
"In promotional materials! Influencers, fans...¬† ¬†Go ask 10 people who they think invented the tablet. Or the true wireless earbuds or the MP3 player.¬†"
Are you trolling?
In the US Market. Not internationally
"Once Apple makes a foldable phone, I think you'll change your mind. Apple is going to invent a real foldable phone. It's invented the smartphone, the touch screen, etc. The foldable phone will be no exception. It'll change everything."
I heard of this screenprotector. Doesn‚Äôt that destroy the screen if removed? XD
[deleted]
Okay fanboy
No. It's a normal plastic protector like on any phone and can buy on amazon or let samsung change it for you. Some people even remove it so the screen looks and feels better without the plastic cover
Are you slow?
"NFC, wireless charging, apple pay, apple watch, air drop, swipe keyboard, AI (lol) and a bunch more I can't think of at the moment."
"What exactly are you looking for dude? You asked for examples were Apple gets credit for things they didn't invent and people listed a dozen examples.¬†


What exactly do you need like do you want notarized letter from Steve Jobs saying so? It's become public shorthand that Apple invented tablets and mp3 players and wireless earbuds.¬†¬†"

"Not an app, but I frequently use Smart Select which I have on the Side Panel. Comes in handy when I want to screenshot a portion of the screen and just copy it to the clipboard without saving. Oh, and from my experience, it doesn‚Äôt let the app know you screenshoted (if it checks)."
"\- Smart Switch to transfer file between phone especially if you love to trade in every year  
\- SmartThings is useful if you use any home living with SmartThings compatibility, also work with SmartTag or Galaxy Ring  
\- Samsung Members is Samsung global community, based on your region  
\- Samsung Flow, it's like Phone Link i guess? i own Windows so i prefer Phone Link + Link To Windows combo to connect both my Windows and Samsung phone wirelessly, i also prefer QuickShare to share big file between them wirelessly, oh right i don't have interest with Tablet, so perhaps Samsung Flow is better if you own a Galaxy Tab

i don't use others"
"Tidypanel, not free but gets rid of all sticky notifications. Best purchase I‚Äôve made 6yrs ago."
This isnt necessarily an app but the side bar holy crap it is the love of my life
"I don't really have use for any of those. I used to use Samsung browser but there's no extension support or at least barely any. And it's a chromium browser to boot so even if it had extension support it would be quite limited. 

most importantly there's no ublock origin (not even the lite) version 

The shopping app is basically indistinguishable from the browser app for shopping. Even something like Smart switch.... Android has a pretty seamless way to back up your phones on Google one even if you're not on a paid account. if you have a Google account you can back it up on Google one.... so there's really no reason to go out of your way to use anything else. 

you can if you want I suppose but it's officially part of the setup process to back up a phone that way. 

I do use good lock of course and theme park. And the themes can be fun.  obviously Samsung notes app is great although it's a huge bummer it doesn't work on non-Galaxy laptops anymore

but most of the other stuff to me is bloat."

"Hi,

I was going through every single Samsung app on the Google store and was wondering if i was missing out on any of the apps. I am wondering especially about the apps in the photos.

1. Do you use any of these apps?
2. What do you use them for/why?"
"Regarding the distinction between ""Phone Link"" and ""Link to Windows,"" it is important to clarify their functionalities. Can both applications be installed on both PC and mobile devices?

**Link to Windows:**
*   The application is accessible via the Play Store, although the app icon may not be immediately visible; it can be located through a search function on your mobile device.
*   A direct download for the PC version is not readily available.

**Phone Link:**
*   The application is not readily available for download on either the mobile device or the PC; it is not present in the Windows 11 taskbar."
That's well known¬†
How often/when do you use it?
I used to use it so much on my note 9. Do you experience a slight delay between opening and circling? Like almost a one second delay?
Smart Switch is great for backing up your phone to your PC. It backs up EVERYTHING
"Wait, Phone Link and Link to Windows is not the same thing? Can both apps be installed on PC and phone?  

**Link to Windows**:  
* Installed through Play Store, but you cant see app icon, just search it up on your phone.  
* Cant find download for PC  
  
**Phone Link**:  
I literally cant find download for this on my phone or PC, its not in my win11 taskbar."
"Really? I never used it, whats the difference from just hitting home-button and then clicking the app on your homepage?"
"What browser do you use?

Shopping app, do you mean Samsung Members?

Smart Switch is to transfer your data from one phone to another, right? Googles only has 15GB free backup as far i know. Fills up pretty quick."

Yeah sadly. Since the OneUI 7 update I think. When they added those Galaxy AI themed animations to it. Doesn‚Äôt let you select for a second or two‚Ä¶
Phone Link should be on Microsoft app store.
"Just convenience and you can stuff a ton of apps in there, i keep socials, phone tweak apps, and a bit of some entertainment in it. Seeing as you can also make it completely transparent and you can make apps invisible, it can act as a secret app bar :)"

"They used the quick measure fucnction while in the shop? I thought the paper tag would say its dimensions, but still smart.

"I gotcha! Termux, shizuku, activity launcher, and app manager. The secret app needs to be changed to not be searchable via settings and you would need to make your side bar completely transparent(if you ever forget you could always make it opaque again)

Termux is a local cmd shell its decently powerful but needs some setup and pairs with shizuku

Shizuku is a local adb shell that needs something like termux to work(also uses wireless debugging thru developer options)

App Manager and activity launcher show hidden activities but app manager can manifest code(app does need to be debuggable)"
"people still continue to buy them this subreddit everyone seemed eager to pre order it and pay only ""700"" for the phone acting like their zfold 6 was free or somthing lol"
Drip feeding innovation is lack of market competition. There is no need to spend on innovating when there is no real competition in that space.  Tri-opoly or something.
Foldable is a very small market at the moment. I don't see this happening.
"Despite the high price point, consumer demand persists, as evidenced by the enthusiastic pre-order activity within this online community, where individuals appeared willing to invest ""$700"" for the device, seemingly disregarding the cost of their existing Zfold 6."
I've seen this somewhere before...
"Well I know Samsung is the main one right now but a few years back LG was mopping the floor with them. I had my V60 thinQ and I had the removable second screen and it was amazing. You go make it one full screen with a admittedly annoying seam in the middle, or you could have to completely separate screens doing separate things. Like, having YouTube open while playing a game on the other screen and it didn't lag or stutter. I really miss LG phones. Samsung phones are good but they're just better iPhones for people that prefer Android OS"
"The solution: vote with your wallet and do not buy their products. Go with Vivo, Honor, or Oppo.

Typed on my Vivo x200 Pro in the USA."
"They're probably being cautious with battery tech and using reliable suppliers. With the recent Chinese power bank recall fiasco that caused even Anker to recall over a million power banks, I would be too. Imagine having to recall millions of smartphones, would be a nightmare."
Right on point. Samsung goes out of their way to limit features based on CSC and custom firmware. Apple or Google don't even do this....I'd be using Vivo if it wasn't for band 71
"I agree with Samsung being very comfortable, but at least the batteries are good.

I will take 2000 charge cycles and a slightly smaller battery over 1000 charges and a bit bigger battery any day, so I am happy with the current batteries.

And when SiCa matures, we get the size upgrade, without loosing on the cycles (most important for battery longevity)"
"One of my first cell phones more than 20 years ago was a Samsung. Foldables aren't worth the prize for the used hardware and screws. People are opening their phones more than 50 times per day lol. I hope this stays a small market.

About your complaining of the battery, true. But if one knows the size of a battery, why buy a phone with a small battery when there are other devices out there?"
"They're just trying to maximize their profit margins and because there's not much competition in the US they don't gave to do much.¬†


But again there's not that much money in dominating the foldable industry it accounts for less than 1% of Samsung's market. and that includes flippables if you erase flippables the market for foldable book phones is just a rounding error.¬†


Really doesn't matter if you dominate that market it's a halo product. It accounts for like 20% of the media but less than 1 out of every 20 Samsung users will ever use one¬†


It generates a lot of hype but with a really hoping is that the people that see the fold commercials will just remember the name Samsung when they go to Walmart to buy a new prepaid phone. That's where Samsung's bread is buttered in the US market especially is prepaid"
"Yeah, it‚Äôs called rolling debt or the perpetual upgrade trap. Carriers were pulling this kind of move long before Samsung jumped in with their trade-in program. Samsung basically admits how fast these phones lose value when you look at their own trade-in offers. The Fold 6 256GB launched at $2,564.99 CAD, and just a year later they‚Äôre offering $1,045 for it. That‚Äôs a loss of over 60 percent in 12 months. I still upgrade every year because I like folding phones, but they‚Äôre not at the point where I‚Äôd actually keep one long-term. The changes are small, and honestly, I hate them, but they‚Äôre slowly getting to a place where a foldable feels like a proper daily driver.

I kept my S22 Ultra for over three years because the upgrades weren‚Äôt worth it, but the Fold isn‚Äôt quite there yet. And Samsung knows that; they‚Äôre milking every minor improvement along the way. I mean, I have disposable income, so I don‚Äôt really mind blowing money on this kind of stuff. But when I see my buddy or his wife financing their brand new iPhone Pro Max while their credit cards are maxed out and they have to park a car because they can‚Äôt afford gas, I can‚Äôt help but laugh. People have some wild priorities."
Thats the TRAP of Trade-In for yah üòÇ
More of a duopoly but yes. We can still put pressure on Samsung though.
"Since those devices are missing USA and Canada frequency bands support, they are automatically ruled out for anyone who needs a reliable communication device for use in the US and/or Canada....you know, a phone

Not to mention their software is worse than Samsungs."
"True. However, the second issue mentioned also applies to their non-Foldable devices, which hampers people who travel outside the US and Canada.

So that feedback, is for their entire lineup."
I have my s23 ultra for use at home and for photos and my z fold 6 for outside usage gunna keep the combo as long as possible till they release a capable fold with long battery like the ultra and same cameras as well
"We stop buying it, doesn‚Äôt pressure them to improve, it pressures them to drop the line for lack of profit‚Ä¶"
"Oh no! How will I break the news to my wife that she has to stop using her Oppo? How will I reply to this post only Vivo? I guess my 5G+ connection just isn't enough.

Global variants exist because they work...globally. And this argument about software I just find hilarious. Android vs android, what a battle!"
Missing SOME US frequency bands. TMobile tends to have the best support for global models. It's not the complete set of bands but it's enough to work in the majority of cases. Buying it requires an import or third party seller obviously.
"the will still be a buch of goon out there buying this not because they need it, but because of overconsumerism"

RIP to the S-Pen in the next year or two ‚òπÔ∏è
Why no S Pen? I was actually thinking about finally getting a Fold. I guess that decision has been made for me.
"Also missing features promised or could've made improvements but they didn't deliver was I would've gotten Fold 7-

-IP 68
-Vapor cooling chamber
-Anti reflective glass

And of course larger battery or faster charging 45w"
And they removed under display selfie camera
thicker ultra-thin glass?
"I get not putting the s pen in the phone itself if you want to make it thinner, but why not at least leave the compatibility so that you can get a case and put an S pen in it?"
Still annoyed they removed the under display camera
It's a hard pass at this point. üíÄ
How is the phone 1.4mm thinner when unfolded but 3.2mm thinner when folded? Where did those extra 0.4mm come from?
"*no* sPen support? I really love it to multitask using notes app and what ever app i need to write notes on. Glad I got the Fold 6 last year, I'll definitely be keeping this one for awhile."
"I thought both phones were stunning in person. I‚Äôll probably skip the Z Flip and Fold this year due to the high prices and terrible trade in values. That was the reason I didn‚Äôt upgrade to the Flip 6 last year and ended up getting an S25 once my warranty was up on the Flip 5.

No S-Pen is very disappointing though. The size of the Z Fold 7 was very impressive and I really liked it. It‚Äôs just too expensive for me."
Fold with a huge Display and not even a S Pen support
"At this point, the only reason I stay with Samsung is the ultra camera(s) and the crazy trade-in prices."
Forgot the ugly camera mountain.
Did anyone like the in-display front camera?
saw it in person and nearly busted
$2k...That's more expensive than a 65 inch OLED TV.
"if they dont plan on bringing back the s pen for the fold 8 and above i wont be going back to samsung, that is one of the reasons why i get the fold"
No pen support. Now that sucks
"I just wish they didn't have the slowest charging phone,  25w is unacceptable in 2025 when competing models that are cheaper are 400% faster."
Why is the fold still $2000
No spen no buy. Not to mention i hate no sd card.
A S pen is a absolute 100% must for me.
Inner display camera that covers your videos and games*
"Unpopular opinion: I‚Äôll gladly trade the pen I never use for a thinner device. <shrugs> Now, if they could just use a better battery‚Ä¶.."
"For personal reference: Reasons for me not upgrading to the Fold 7

1. Losing the S pen support despite being a mini tablet
2. Losing the UDC, and having a large inner camera hole being visible during a video
3. Losing the vapor chamber not being able to utilize the Snap 8 Elite chipset's full performance and disperse heat uniformly. (YouTube review comparisons show Fold7 to have 3 degrees lower temperature with near identical battery time compared to Fold6 on workload tests)
4. No upgrade in batteries, despite wider screen, leading to barely no battery time increase despite the Snap 8 Elite chipset (Some youtube reviews show the battery time to be even *shorter* than the Fold6)
5. Worse speakers performance due to thinner thickness and smaller sound space
6. Wider screen not being an upgrade for videos
7. Wider screen and heavier camera on the top giving a worse weight distribution
8. Thinner thickness and upgrade in camera module leading to the outer camera bulk being extremely protruded, making the phone wobble when laid flat
9. Thinner thickness leading to smaller buttons and making it harder to grip and open
10. Youtube reviews show the Fold7 does not open completely flat (180 degrees) and slightly less than the Fold 6
11. No white color scheme
12. Not much improvement in the folding crease"
"No S pen and no UDC is a dealbreaker for me. I'll skip this gen, maybe get a flip for my kids"
"utter shit battery that won't last you a day of heavy usage for 2000$ , great scam you pulled samesung

competition has 6000mah at half the price and actually flagship cameras . Good thing your target customer is the type who never researches and just buys with the crowd."
Price to high for a device without S Pen support
"Using samsung z fold without S pen is like,carrying Ipad as a cell phone"
Stupid price
Why would you get this without the S Pen?  I was planning on getting one of these phones for that reason.  That sucks
Im torn between the flip and the fold.
"Ic only they stopped raising prices for not reason other than greed. It's been fine 7 years agora when the flexible display tech was new and fresh and the phone came with a lot of stuff, but now all those years later, they make it expensive just for the sake of being expensive..
 It's finally time for sub 1000 bucks fold !"
S-pen is the only reason I would justify the price of a fold. This just kills it for me
Amazing. üòª
No battery update is a nono for me. Samsung wake up!!
"A 10mp camera? Really, on a $2,000 device?"
"The lack of S Pen support is very disappointing. One UI is amazing, but aside from that, Samsung followed after Apple. Removing features and raising the price is disrespectful. The gaslighting about the usage survey is a double slap. If the S Pen is removed on the S26 Ultra, then I will be going elsewhere. My very first phone was a Galaxy S2. Greed over innovation is the reason why Samsung is tanking. Thin phones only mean cost-cutting, and talking about AI means you've changed nothing. Now, they want to sell AI as an MRC. Despicable."
"Will be my first fold. Got the flip 5 2 years ago because i wanted to know how it is to have a foldable smart phone and i love it. Was then thinking about getting the fold 6 just out of curiosity but it was way to thick. A few friends in the states have one and i could check it out. Nobody in my country has a foldable phone and im starting to think im the only one xD

Very interested in how it will be to have the fold. I really just bought it for fun. The flip 7 will be my new main phone because i can go back to a normal sized phone anymore. Its just to convenient to have a small one for my work (and yes i really pre ordered both dont judge me pls)"
"This is the second lackluster phone released by Samsung. Im not sure what's going on over there. Who really cares if it's a few mm thinner. The main selling points of any smartphone, battery, cameras, battery,and battery and then battery. They push the AI stuff that no one cares about. It's fun to play with the first hour you have the phone. I still have my 24U because the Samsung 25U was a step backward and an iPhone clone, and now the fold7 is just a slightly thinner fold6 that costs more. Samsung has better battery tech, why arent they using it? They have better cameras, people want the pens, the Note line was extremely popular. The fold should be THE device.  It should have the best of the best in it, followed by the Ultra's. For the longest time, Samsung was releasing one iPhone killer after another. Constantly shaking up the market. Now, it's just photo copies."
I have observed that people who are actually rich have fold phones not iPhone it's just an observation I am not even exaggerating people want to look rich prefer iPhone's people who are they don't care
Actually the design and color already got me... and s-pen is not so important to me. Just the price that stops me.
I think the Fold 7 feels amazing. The engineering is really impressive. Super slim and lightweight.
"""50% thicker ultra thin glass"" what?"
"There is no reason to upgrade beyond a S24 ultra at the moment.  The specs are not worth it, the ""AI"" is not worth it, and the price is not worth it.  There's nothing innovative here."
No one asked the pen to be removed. Samsung just wants to save money and increase profit margins. I hope this series tank and made them rethink of the spen and udc.
"I was at a store and I tried opening the Fold 7 and boy...it was difficult!  Finally resorted to using my fingernails to pry it open.  Went to a different colored one and was only slightlyyyyy easier to open.

Will stick with my Flip 5 which I can open with just a flick of my wrist.  And the Flip 7 is way too expensive."
It looks like a refrigerator in this picture
"very meh, i dont understand why they keep pushing folds"
Too pricey. They would have to be at least 75% cheaper for me to consider spending money on a fold phone.
Ok?
"Gorillas, Gorillas Victus.... next maybe 'Gorilla Maximus Decimus Meridius Glass'"
I sure hope the S25 Ultra isn't the last phone with spen. If they remove it I may consider getting a pixel or OnePlus once I need to upgrade my S25 Ultra.
"Yeah, I have the same feeling"
"If they kill it, there is nothing keeping me in Samsung.

I already started looking at other watches outside of Samsung because they've stopped innovating.

Each generation of phone transcends into iphones. The folds could have been awesome."
They decided they don't need the money. We should oblige them.
"Same here, without spen, Samsung is not special anymore. Any other brand can replace it."
"It‚Äôs funny seeing all the new cases for the fold 7 that have a slot for the S pen, clearly no one though they would stop support."
"Yup. I hope my Fold 5 stays alive for as long as possible. I hope they at least keep the S pen support on S product line.

Once they take away S pen totally, I'm jumping ship to ROG."
I think it is more that the #1 priority on this phone was to make it identical to a flagship slab phone when folded with 0 compromises. Not to have 0 compromises vs other folds. Getting the cameras and size to match what people expect from a flagship. Im sure once they can fit it in it will be back. Either in next year's Z Fold or in the G Fold this year.
"I don't think you are wrong. They ditched the note, they have removed full s pen functionality from the s ultras (with rumours they are getting rid of it altogether this year) and now this. I'm with you I use my s pen all the time. Will have to go to honor for my foldabke once my fold 6 dies"
"I was thinking the same thing.¬†
No S-pen Bluetooth connectivity for the Galaxy S Ultra series and now no¬†S-pen support for the new Fold 7?? ‚òπÔ∏è


It's to the point that, they've gotten rid of so many other features that I've loved, the S-pen/Samsung Notes is pretty much the only thing keeping me around.¬†


If there's no S-pen, then there's no reason for me to stick with a Samsung phone.¬†"
"P.S. Some people love the S-Pen and I don't have anything against it. I just want to express 
my opinion and that they lose customers no matter if they include the S-Pen or not.



S-Pen is a double edge in my opinion. I stopped buying Samsung phones when they brought the S-Pen into regular flagship phones because I never use it and I don't see a point in having it. Samsung will lose customers (potential buyers) no matter if they include the S-Pen or not.


Samsung most likely has metrics built into the OS to track how many people use a certain feature."
You have at least 5 spens per hand. Assimilate!
Guess I won't buy Samsung anymore. The SPen is the reason I use them. There are better phones out there.
"It added tons of thickness and no one really used it. 

Imo make a fold ultra and put the s pen inside"
"Since the lack of an s-pen has produced a thinner phone, l am now looking at getting this phone for the first time."
More people complained about form factor than used the s pen
"you could just, get the 6? they wont just magically disappear like poof"
"Right? Whats the point of unfolding this in the first place? Doomscrolling? Watching vids on youtube? Netflix? WTF Samsung, it's getting harder to love them each year. One of the reason for buying fold is using it for productivity like doing some spreadsheets on the go."
Did you see how thin it is now? Im more surprised they didnt remove any battery to achieve that size. Also anti reflective glass doesnt work on fold phones for multiple reasons.
Honestly main reason I'm hesitant to upgrade
[deleted]
plot twist: it never was there
ultra unthinned
"yeah, that's great. 

When I wake up in the morning, I always think I need thicker ultra-thin glass.  

That feature made my day..."
"Lol, I am going to take the calipers and measure it"
They don't include the bezels when measuring the thickness. In fact none of the manufacturers do. It's a really stupid practice. Us normal people would measure it from the the edge not the middle of the screen.
I pre-ordered. I'm coming from a fold 5. I saw/held it in person for the first time today and I'm a bit worried about it's durability. It feels and looks sleek but a bit dainty
I agree with you there.
Use your finger üôåüèº
Oh you must mean that Lego brick that looks like they glued it to the back as an afterthought. ü§£
i liked the underscreen selfie cam way more
But you can't fit your tv in your pocket
"I'm surprised no one is talking about this, 4400mah battery on a 8"" + 6.5"" foldable is insane, and so far this is the highest price tag I've seen for a foldable (excluding the Huawei tri-fold ofc)"
Which foldable do you recommend?
ü§£üòÇ
I got it because... I don't use the s pen...
"Flip if you need a compact phone to carry. Fold if you need extra screen real-estate, but not often enough to just bring a superior tablet or computer.

Neither if you can't afford rebuying it on a whim as the screens still are more fragile than bar type phones'."
"Easy decision. Fold is coming with Snapdragon 8 Elite, and Flip is rocking a xynox."
Flip has Exynos so avoid it
The flips are really good i recommend you try one in store¬†
"That one is inside the display, it's probably a technical limitation. If you want a 200mp selfie camera, just unfold the phone and use the rear camera plus the little screen."
They can claim that because they took out the part of the screen for the S-Pen support. And they were able to thicken the glass instead. Just what I read about the design process.
"I work in a job that occasionally requires remote calls on the road. Being able to unfold the phone and get into a tablet size web browser for a  site that does not work on phone browsers? it's fantastic. Plus watching videos and playing games is a much better experience. I've been on a default 6, and battery is my own complaint but it's not that bad. I'm sure it's going to be the same experience for the 7, but the phone looks incredible"
"Can't say about the flip, but I find the case makes it easier to open"
"We have literally only had Gorilla Glass and Gorilla Armor. And if you're talking about Gorilla Glass 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Victus, Ceramic etc, those are genuinely different and they do warrant different numbers. Well, apart from Victus i guess, i dont think they did anything totally different than making the glass stronger like before"
And it will have its vengeance.  In this life or the next.
I really hope they won't remove it. It is a feature that you don't think you need it until you use it.
According to very early leaks the S26U will still have it
"I am using a Samsung S23 Ultra after selling my S24 Ultra and the reason was outstanding design, amazing grip to hold, 10x optical camera and Bluetooth enabled Samsung S pen. If they kill S pen, then I have other phone and that's OnePlus 13 1TB and I will get another OnePlus and my life will be sorted for the next at least, at least 3 years."
Pixel and OnePlus have a pen?
"Dude, the S-Pen isn't everything. I bought the NP3apro because my S23u broke. I have a Pixel. We have almost the same interface. But what makes Samsung Samsung is OneUI... It's definitely far ahead of all UIs. Onehand operation is a game changer. I was looking to get a Pixel 10 Pro, but decided to wait for the S26 series."
"Exactly. If I wanted an iPhone, I would have bought one.¬†"
Not the case. The number of people using the s-pen doesn't justify the cost of incorporating it into this and future phones. Hence why it's being dropped.
It's a very unexpected move by Samsung.
"Not pointy enough tho, I like to use S-Pen for note taking and using just fingers is tough."
Like who for example? üëÄ‚úçÔ∏èüèæ
"Fold was supposed to be THE ""Ultra"". But yk samsung might as well make Fold Ultra and S26 Ultra Pro or sumn"
"stop!  It's false , it barely doesn't add any thickness .It's a cost cutting feature"
Make it cost even more money!
"Plus it required an extra layer added to the screen, adding thickness and complexity."
"That's great and all, but that's not what we're talking about. They removed S-pen *support*, not just onboard storage. The screen layer to support the S-Pen is microns thick, so it would not have impacted thickness. I use an S-Pen with my S21U all the time, and it has no onboard storage. This is egregious on Samsung's part, and I hope it bites them (but it won't)."
"the 6 that's twice as thick? lol, no dear..."
You guys still love them? I disliked them ever since they took my headphone jack... SCREW YOU SAMSUNG
I agree but was it really good? I think this technology is maybe too premature
"They did, there is still a camera but not under the screen"
"There is an under display cam on fold 6 on the big screen

https://preview.redd.it/5mrhgchyilcf1.jpeg?width=299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=623ec6b701bda15c519c99e3b237876cfbf6eb9f"
But...this is about thickness...how am i not supposed to measure the bezels when its exactly what makes the phone thick?
That is a good point. It‚Äôs so thin that I‚Äôd be scared to own it without a warranty and a backup phone. I talked to a Samsung Ambassador at Best Buy and he said to get the warranty and that he wouldn‚Äôt own a Fold without it. He said they‚Äôre sturdy but very expensive to fix.
Honestly none of them
"Xfold 5

You can find it on tradingshenzhen"
Xynox sounds like a boner pill
"I don't think they meant a selfie camera. Telephoto is a small 10 MP sensor, like on the S25 Ultra, which is ridiculous for the price Samsung is asking."
"I know, but $2,000 is so much money for that. I'm sure they could've gotten something better."
"Scratch resistance is better, shatter and crack never upgraded"
"Gorillius Augustus Maximus Victus Princeps, Emperor of the Romans"
Is there anywhere that has a breakdown of the difference between the versions?
"They got me hooked to the S Ultra line because of the S Pen. If they get rid of it, I have no reason to consider a Samsung phone instead of a Pixel, for example."
"I'm a civil engineer. I use it constantly to mark up plans, sketches, etc."
use it for what
Since the s25 U though even that isn't a proper s pen
I really hope so because I want to upgrade from my s23 ultra üò≠
If Samsung doesn't and those phones have better cameras then why even stay
"Currently trying a Pixel. Totally agree about OneUI. I don't even use the Samsung Launcher (using Nova on both my s25 and Pixel 9) but Samsung is still a WAY better experience that stock Pixel. 

That's said, I think if I installed CRDroid on Pixel I'd be able to get it how I like it"
"I don't care about oneui as much as the spen 

I use the camera way more than I do gawking at oneui, I use the spen more than gawking at oneui

If they don't have an spen, I won't be getting a Samsung."
"If that is their issue, then I am fine with them selling the S-pen separately just so they can justify their ""cost"".

But I hope they don't remove S-pen support on the phones. In fact, I hope they can also support mid range phones and make its connectivity more seamless. It is nice to kinda use the Spen on the tablet then on the phone, then back to tablet.

Sadly, this is all just wishful thinking."
That's such a confusing response. That doesn't change the fact that those of us who buy Samsung purely for the S Pen will now look elsewhere instead of giving them money.
"Knowing Samsung they‚Äôll say it was due to the limited amount of users actually utilising the pen, but the likely reason is people being too hard on the inside screen with the pen leaving long lasting marks, obviously not an issue Samsung is bothered by if the user has bought the device outright and has no extended warranty but I‚Äôd put money on them not wanting to deal with the warranty claims or the reduced value for trade in devices with those marks."
Buy a keyboard. JK¬†
"The classic answer will be the vivo x200 ultra and the xiaomi 15 ultra global for normal non fold phones. (The z fold 7 might be the best fold right now in the west though when looking at the whole package!)

 in the west, those are less supported and accessible, so the very small upgrade youll get with them might still be more of an inconvenience when trying to get accessories or network bands (vivo)

Plus you dont get any carrier deals since they arent properly supported, so you just pay for the phone and do a bring own device plan, although plenty of people do that anyway (even for normal NA phones)"
You are literally wrong
"\>¬†since they took my hesdphone jack

The problem with it is that after few years (almost) everyone followed. I also hate no jack, no sd, holes in the screen but there's no alternative (for me, that have features I want - eg. long updates)."
I would honestly rather just have no camera on the fold screen don't think if ever used it on my fold 5 or 6. One of the biggest advantages of the fold imo is being able to use the main rear camera as a selfie and still see the picture on the front screen.
"and this was a device released to the public? Get one then.

I still miss the pop out camera of my Mi9tpro. It was a great phone... Xiaomi tanked after that one, especially with updates."
Exynos. Lol
"Well I don't know about the telephoto, but the only 10mp camera in this post is the ""inner-display camera"" which I'm not sure that it can be physically bigger than 10mp with current technology"
Right because we know that Samsung specifically chose a 10mp camera to spite you.
This. I wish they'd focus om scratch resistant with every iteration.
"""It scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7."""
"They have a process called ""ion exchange"" or whatever idk how it works. You can see scratch and drop resistance differences if you google them, though there is no source that has everything. But yes there is definitely a difference. 

However the thing is, if it becomes too scratch resistant, then it will become more prone to cracking. And I have seen this first hand. Victus on my S23 Ultra got LOTS of hairline scratches but was really resistant to cracking (I drop it a lot lol). Whereas the Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra actually scratched closer to a level 7, but I'm guessing that makes it not as drop resistant, so they toned it back with Armor 2."
"Yes, me too! Samsung Ultra line is nice even without S-pen but that is one of the feature that make it stand out among the rest."
Dumb question but is the S Pen still currently usable on the new Zfolds? Just not sold with it?
"I mean, it still completely functional minus a few extra features. The whole thing can't function if the digitiser layer is removed, which is what happened with the fold 7. Those Bluetooth features didn't even exist until the Note 9, 7 years after the S pen introduction. So what is a proper s pen can be debatable."
"I'm selling my Pixel 9 XL for $600 on eBay and switching to Fold 7. I love the pixel's camera. However, horrible horrible signal with E-SIM"
"There is also a software cost. I have never used an s-pen, so not sure what l missing out on, if anything. Samsung know how many people use the s-pen, and then decided on what course off action to take.

I am not saying what they are doing is right or wrong. It's a decision us consumers have to live with and factor it in when deciding on what phone to get next."
"I heard that another layer needs to be added for the pen to work, and that omitting that allows them to make the phones thinner."
You know that's absolutely bullshit right?
The likely reason is them saving money for themselves and not having to offer more for us
"Both of those companies are involved heavily with the CCP, no thanks..."
They don't have one ui though.
Why are those the typical answers? Like what would you say makes them unique?
cope OPPO N5 8.9mm bigger battery and Pen support on both screen
Yeah I agree but I think they have an obligation to put this camera
Fold 6 was released to the public?
I have been complaining about them a lot in front of my Samsung phone. Maybe you're on to something? /s
I knew something was gonna JerryRig it! ü§£
"dunno man, my S24 Ultra has got no scratches after 2 years, and I've dropped the phone many times, no crack. it's a gem."
"Personally I'm not sure why would you make it scratch resistant, just slap some screen protector on it and you're golden.

I know, just slap the case on it then... but let's just say I think screen protector is more effective at what it does."
"Is it a practical difference though? Like if most things that scratch and crack glass are at a Level 9 and they keep making upgrades over the years to make it resist level 1,2,3,4,5 while making it sound like they are doing big stuff does it actually matter to us at all?"
"Yap, that's it. It's an amazing phone on its own but the S-Pen is that detail that I think ""can I get anything similar anywhere else? No.""."
"No. It has never been sold with it, but now they don't have the digitizer necessary to interact with the pen."
My understanding is that it doesn't support it but don't take it as an certain.
No it doesn't work at all. They have removed the digitizer
"That's not true surely? I had the note 8, note 10, nore 20, S23 ultra and they all had Bluetooth connectivity in their s pen. I've even got the now discontinued s pen pro so I can have those features in my fold. But alas they have now removed them from their ultra line up"
"The Samsung CEO was attempting a poor joke/justifiction in a clip I saw recently that only 20% of consumes use the S-pen. Hence, the reason they dropped it on the Fold/Flip 7. 

I don't care if .00000000000001% uses it, paid for it for it as a whole, and it should remain part of the phone's appeal. And on a larger production scale of phones sold, it really doesn't matter if folks use it or not. It's already built into the cost. 

That said, the writing is on the wall; I am almost sure the S-Pen will be dropped on all Samsung phones in the near future. The higher-tier tablets would probably be the only ones for now that will survive the S-pen cost-cutting."
"I really don't like this thinner trend. I would be happier with a phone that is 3 or 4mm thicker, as long as the battery was bigger."
"I mean, other than the iphone which is a different OS and ecosystem, among android phones, those would be the best phones out right now, and maybe throw in the pixel series for cost and camera

Nothing really makes them unique, the hardware is very slightly better in some instances and the camera might pick up different things across these devices based on what youre capturing but will look mostly the same. The samsung has an spen which is the only unique thing, but even that might get phased out

In this day and age you would just get the ecosystem you want to be in (apple, samsung, google, whatever the chinese ones are) and the UI you prefer (apple, oneui, pixel, the chinese ones)

Vivo and Xiaomi will charge faster and have a larger battery on paper but after software optimization across the board its similar"
"One is Wacom, the other isn't. It's a different technology."
"hrmpf, you're right. I can only guess... it probably reduced the yield in manufacturing the displays, or it reduced photo quality and more people complained than liked it. So it did not come out as a feature on the Fold 7."
"Anyways, the Fold isn‚Äôt a $2000 phone because of the cameras and it‚Äôs not even due to the screens, one of which can fold. It‚Äôs because that‚Äôs where the market has dictated the price should be across different OEMs and people are gladly paying the price to be part of the club. 

The price and type of components don‚Äôt really explain the price of the device, that‚Äôs all marketing."
"Screen protectors reduce screen clarity. Can also interfere with touch, especially with any moisture on your fingers. Some have also been shown to do more damage than good.¬†"
Thank you this is really helpful!
Thanks!
That‚Äôs so dumb thanks!
"That would be Spen air command, which was activated by hovering it over the screen. Would put it in range of the magnetic field. Have a similar thing available with other various Wacom tech stylus, switch from pen to eraser for example.


https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/since-2011-looking-back-at-the-s-pens-history-of-innovation

Good look at how it changed through each iteration"
"\> only 20%¬†

That really feels like a joke. 20% is 1/5... every 5th user and lots of them (including me) probably bought it for the support.

I thought it was like 5% and even then I wouldn't trade it.

I feel that Samsung is really lucky Jobs is no longer alive, because recently the premium phones branch tries so hard to make suicide."
It really depends on your use for battery. Never really found charging slow these years with samsung so probably ganna stick with it till a better option pops. I do not trust xiomi and vivo shops in my country especially with how many faulty devices I have seen my friends get from them
"It really isn't, it still needs a digitiser to detect the pen. 

Samsung wants to save money by giving you less for the same price and you're letting them"
"Yeah I'm not sure Samsung actually cared that people didn't like it, since they had an under display selfie camera in the Fold for 4 generations."
So basically it's like the sliding phones of yesterday?
No I'm talking gesture control. And camera shutter. It's only the s25 where they have killed all this
"Man, you just said something....Steve Jobs' brilliance brought the brilliance out of others including his competition. I'd like to believe the industry would look a lot different (in a good way) and be more consumer-friendly if he were still with us."
The pen draws power from the screen. You need a layer of copper (that doesn't flex) on each side of the screen to power it on.
Air actions... How much you willing to sell that spen pro for? I lost mine! And can't find where to buy one!
"wacom works that way

afaik samsung used the way wacom does it so.."
Ah sorry I'm holding on to it. Samsung have killed it so I'm keeping this until it dies
"Yeah, that's what I said. Samsung uses WACOM EMR, I dont think Oppo does, you cant really compare Wacom EMR to Ntrig, or anything else since Wacom is the industry leader and superior to everything else"
I doubt they're losing money at the prices they are charging. This is just optics to try and make the insane prices seem less insane
They'll make it back by denying valid warranty claims left and right when they inevitably fail in a year.
They‚Äôll get it back from the terrible trade in value
"LoL..finally after the nonexistent upgrades on the fold 4,5...but probably  because fold 6 hardware not being able to compete with other foldables and they still had to cut cost by removing spen on fold 7 and use the smallest battery of all foldables.
Too bad they still haven't fixed the motion blur issue on the camera..."
"Why won't the put the exact same cameras in the ultra in their $2000 foldable?

![gif](giphy|JSueytO5O29yM)"
"I do like the Samsung's approach to FE. Watch FE was basically Watch 4, but with latest SW. Same goes for Z Flip FE, rebranded Z flip 6 with exynos processor.

This makes their latest entry level device more affordable.

Obviously I would love to see Z Fold FE but they won't because still it would be as expensive as Ultra series, and at that price point, ppl won't get a ""entry level"" device."
Then don't cut features while raising the price?
I'll believe that when the fold price frops down by at least $500
Like the dogshit Exynos chip?
With the prices and crap trade in values I'm not seeing this
"What's he talking about ? They lost tons of money on the flip 6 with all the refunds, replacement, and repairs on theor dime lmao"
Less money ?? What were they going to ask for Fold 7 ? Kidney ??
"As long as the fold display can be scratched at a level 2, my fingernail can cause severe damage,  anything more than $99.99 is a nonstarter for me.

At $2000, this device should be top tier best of the best, camera is inferior in their own product line with a cheaper device, cognitive dissonance."
They'll be making less money because they ask 2000e for a phone with big display and absolutely trash battery while competition at half the price offers 6000mah
"So basically Samsung‚Äôs playing the long game here. They‚Äôre willing to take a hit on margins now to make foldables mainstream and lock in users. Classic ‚Äúbleed now, dominate later‚Äù strategy. They know once you‚Äôre hooked on the form factor, you‚Äôre not switching back to slabs."
"I absolutely refuse to spend more then 500‚Ç¨ (and even then, I think is too much, 400‚Ç¨ should be the sweet spot) for a phone in 2025


It's a daily object that could break, drop, get wet, let dust/sand inside, be exposed to extreame heat or cold.


Sure, almost everything can be avoided by careful planning; but I do not want to be scared of bringing my cellphone to the beach because if a guts of wind bring some sand between the screens I will have ruined a thousand money phone.


Feature side, right now pretty much every phone that's not trash tier is the same (thanks to their obsession with always online cloud and service, if all processing is on the cloud, even a thin client is enough); they only keep gatekeeping the camera because that's their only choice to keep market segmentation."
"Indeed, the only thing they said is they absorbed some cost (as in, the Fold 7 is slightly more expensive to make, but the price didn't increase proportionally) and nobody even hinted at losing money. 

Foldables come with high profit margins that would be insane if they could scale sales and make them mainstream, which is what Samsung is trying to work towards without giving in on pricing to the point those margins become notably less cushy. 

Personally, I think it's a losing gamble. They were first and could've taken that market by storm. But holding onto their golden egg gamble meant little demand for a $2000 device that's technically less capable and less robust than a much cheaper Ultra, and also allowed time for Chinese rivals to catch up offering similar or better hardware for far less, leading global adoption outside of North America."
Not losing money. Just making less profit.
"Out of curiosity, what manufacturer gives better trades than Samsung?"
"I was wondering about this. I don't really want a foldable phone (folds are failure points). But I figured I'd see what the trade in would be for my s25. I was surprised how low it was.¬†


The other things I noticed they didn't give any where near as much of a store credit, or an in store discount when buying the phone. When I got my s25 I got a free pair of buds 3 pro, and a galaxy watch ultra for $300. I figured I add that to the fold 7 pre order, and they want $700 for that same purchase. They didn't give any buying credit and only a %15 discount, when I pre-ordered the s25 that was a %50 discount on the watch and a $200 credit that covered the buds.¬†"
I think it's ridiculous for my fold 5 to get only $500? Like what??? It was $1900 two years ago. Does Samsung really not think their phones hond value?? But then some iPhone X's are getting $1000. Like what??
"I mean, now when the camera bump is so goddamn large in comparison to the body and the phone rocks on a table like crazy, might as well have made it that little bit bigger to have some good cameras in there. 

Honestly, I wouldn't even require Ultra-level cameras, but I just wish they could have a 5x zoom at least like most of their competitors, as well as a better main camera. Haven't really seen that many photos from the main lens yet though, so I will say that it might already be quite good. But a 3x, 10 megapixel telephoto in 2025 is embarrassing unless we're talking on a sub $600 phone of something."
I would settle for the S2__ quality camera.
How bad is it?
I don't know about your fold 7 but my battery is easily lasting a full day.. I would hardly call it 'trashy'.
It's really because they know Apple is going to release their versions soon and they have to grab as much market share before that happens.
[deleted]
"I would absolutely love to get a fold but the price point is just too ridiculous for me to consider, especially right now."
Samsung's trade offers have been shit for the last year or so from what I've seen. I think those days may be over.
"It's a trade-in, not a resale for your phone's actual worth. They are more likely to increase the value of iPhone trade-in to entice Apple users to make them jump ship into the Samsung ecosystem."
Are you in America? I am seeing 900 for my fold 5.
"I'm sure it takes some great photos. Samsung has really perfected their camera software. I want the ultra cameras for the zoom like you mentioned and the fact that the phone is to expensive not to have the best of everything the company has at it's disposal. You can't ask for $2000 and have a clearly better product for $700 cheaper with stylus support. It makes no sense at it's current price point not to be the ultra foldable equivalent.

![gif](giphy|kRLYdDS71ICZfNweRZ|downsized)"
"It's not a bad device at all. It's actually an impressive piece of tech. But they are choosing not to go all in on the cameras. Maybe they feel like it isn't necessary because people use a device if this size for something other than content creation and film making. 

Or maybe they feel it would hurt the amount of Ultras they would sell if it had the same camera setup. There's definitely a reason they are differentiating the two devices camera hardware."
"4400mah on such an expensive device with big display is absolute trash and will last a day of moderate usage and that's when is new.

Even s25u is trashy at 5000mah and s26u is rumored to come won't the same for 7th year in a row. Real flagships next year will come with 7000mah, they already have 6000mah now, Samsung phones are just straight outdated now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckqbHtcNrKo

I Had Samsung flagships for 12 year, I'm not a idiot anymore to allow them to scam me for my hard worked money, if you value your money research and pay for hardware.

Typed from my x200 ultra."
My Fold6 can't make it through the day working from home on wifi the entire time. Worst battery life I've ever had in a phone by far.
If that's their plan they are stupid imo. If Apple releases any foldable Samsung might as well just stop making them.
"I'm writing this from my S21FE and I was looking forward the flip 7 FE, but even with all their """"discount"""" is stil about 800‚Ç¨; I do not think is about market but in difference in perceived value.


What are you adding in value for me to justify the increased price?"
"Same, its unbelievably thin now and if i could i would def get it."
Buying used is tempted but I just don't know how they hinge holds up after some years.
This is true. Id probably have a better time just selling my phone online rather than give it to Samsung. Watch in 7 months they increase the trade in value for other phones to help increase sales.
Yeah. I'm not sure why I'm getting so little
I noticed my Flip only goes 10x zoom and was surprised I thought that Samsung phones went far beyond that.
"Seriously, picked up the model at Best buy and it was unreal how light and thin it was"
"Yeah, I wouldn't want to go without some kind of warranty / protection plan. I know normally it's not worth it for insurance but in this case I think it is"
"I originally bought my phone for 2,045 then I was messing around in the app a couple of days later and I somehow saved 191 more dollars. The prices are very weird. Same specs and everything."
"The flip is only 10x no telephoto on it, while the ones with a telephoto go up to 30x unless it's the ultra which goes up to 100x."
Are you in the USA? Which app?
I am. The shop samsung app.
I see my issue. I was looking at the flip 7. You only get $500 with a trade in for that device.
Ok. I'm glad you were able to figure it out.
"Not really, I hate the square metal base then round screen, I hope they kept it round or square but filled frame shape"
The design is ugly for me. I'm more tempted to buy OnePlus watch 3 now more than ever before
"No hype at all, Watch 7 is still super cool and on the right price..."
personally no
"Pleasantly surprised by the design of all models after I saw and tried them on. 
Go see them before making up your mind"
"I preordered it because I want to get access to that upgraded sensor suite, I'm currently using a 3 so it'll be a huge jump for me.  I'm too used to the bezel at this point to kick it"
I'm undecided. I think it looks good. Supposed to be more comfortable on the arm with the new display. I just don't know if it is worth $150 after trading in my Watch 7. Also I have bands I have never used yet .
"Nope.

I have last year's Ultra and there's no reason for me to replace it.

I used to care about the rotating bezel, but I came to.the realization that I didn't miss it all that much."
"I pre-order it. Then saw the galaxy 7 44mm LTE for 199‚Ç¨ brand new and cancelled the pre-order. I saved 120‚Ç¨. 

It's basically the same hardware."
Yep. Waiting on mine. 8 classic bluetooth version :)
Nope. Shit looks fugly
"I really like the look of the 8 Classic. If trade deals were better I would probably upgrade my 6C. I have a hard time getting over the smaller screen size though. For now I'm going to keep my 6C and Ultra, unless they have some sort of really good trade deal in the future."
I have the 8 classic pre-ordered. Upgrading from the watch 3. Been waiting a long time for them to bring back the roataing bezel. This will be a huge upgrade for me. Even if people have the 6 classic too.
I also pre-ordered it but I don't like the fact that they're not able to transfer the watch bands because I have good watch bands For the seven That I love And was hoping to be able to use them On The eight did not know this wasn't an option before I pre-ordered it
Still rocking an active watch 2
This entire generation was a huge miss for me.  There's nothing truly new or interesting.
S2 im still using dont see anything worth my money
"Nope! The square base design on a round face? who approved it.

The design kills it for most people who i've talked to and wanted to upgrade."
"Nope, ugly, expensive and with no substantial upgrades"
"When I checked Samsung app, the trade-in price for 6 classic was shit so I chose to keep it."
just pre-ordered mine.
Not really when the watch 5 and 6 have the same features üòï
"No, I stopped buying Samsung watches. Everytime they let me down or get discontinued very quickly with no support after."
I bought watch 7 for less price lol.
"I've never had a smart watch and, after getting the S25 Ultra earlier this year, was excited to see the Watch 8 unveiling. 
 
As of last week, I am now primarily interested in the Watch 7 instead."
"No hype but I'm getting a pre-order trade in deal with my Watch 7 to upgrade for $60. Pulled the trigger because of the extra 1000 nits in brightness as I find my Watch 7 hard to see sometimes in direct sunlight, even at full brightness."
"I just can't justify paying for it. Like the watch classic 6 is $400 cheaper on Amazon renewed than the newest one¬†


Maybe I'll be excited about it in two years when it's 120 bucks on the resale market"
"From a financial perspective, the perceived value of a $150 expenditure is often assessed through a cost-benefit analysis, with individuals frequently highlighting the initial investment.

However, this perspective may overlook the opportunity cost associated with trading in a device, such as a watch or phone, which inherently diminishes its utility or potential resale value.

Considering the long-term implications, would an annual $150 upgrade expenditure be justifiable, especially when the original device may have retained functionality over the same period?"
"Zero upgrade from the previous version. If I wouldn't have needed another watch, I wouldn't have ordered the ultra either. Square body, round face. So dumb. The base models you give up too much. 2 phones and a watch in a row complete flops. Samsung needs to get its fire back."
"Nope.  Same as my current watch with a little more memory?  I'll wait.   I realize we are at a point where until something truly amazing is created, that a lot of phones, watches aren't going to be true upgrades (now with round corners, now with blue bands).   And that's ok.   It means I won't be tempted to spend money on things I don't really need"
I like it a lot actually. Has some nice haptics. Best Buy offered 2 years data for the LTE version. Why not
"I am still not sure about it. I can get the ultra for 300 Eur in Europe (trade-in my Amazfit GTR 3 + coupons + 150 Euro N26 cashback), but I am too used to the long battery life with my Amazfit which goes for 21 days, and now seeing 2 days battery life sounds to me like a joke. I am considering Garmin Venu 3 (2023), but maybe it is better to wait a little more for Venu 4 to come up which is expected soon I guess."
I preordered it as well and just received an email that it shipped. Excited.
"The best watch in this year's line up for Samsung is; 

Samsung Galaxy watch 8 44 MM LTE

The ultra is like a brick on your arm, the 40 mm has poor battery life and can be a bit small. 

The classic 8, disappointing cause it's 46mm but the screen size is the same as the 40mm watch which is strange, the battery life is same as GW8 44mm, it is more thicker then the watch 8 and not as aesthetic. With the GW8 44mm bigger screen good battery and super slim
 

It's a no brainer"
I'll wait for a while. The pricing is absurd and I'm pretty certain it will drop by a huge margin by the end of the year. Atleast thats the trend here in India.
"I'm going to be grabbing one, love the look and have been waiting for the 8 series to release"
"It certainly looks good. I'm just not a watch man myself, my phone is my watch."
Nah single day battery just doesn't do it for me. I went Garmin.
"Hyped? I'm sorry but did you look at it? That atrocious circle on top of a square is not anywhere close to my idea of a good looking watch..
Yeah gonna keep my Watch 2018 a bit longer I guess."
Anyone upgrading from the Watch6 classic? Curious if it's worth it. I was thinking either the 8 classic or the watch Ultra but afraid it will look too big on my wrist
"It's really ugly, I'm getting the watch 6 classic."
"Hell no.
I just bought my 7 back in October no way am I spending another 300 on the 8 which looks like trash"
"Nope, the squarecle design bugs me, but the biggest offender is how ugly the bezel looks with the wider ridges. All of that combined makes me not want it."
You mean the Fapple watch? No thanks.
"No cos it looks fucking dogtrash, what a horrible design¬†"
"No. Tech is getting pretty stupid when our world is full of homeless tent encampments, murder, drugs too strong, trillion dollars companies, division. At some point we should stop caring about the yearly releases of tech and do something different."
Yeah. It reminds me of an enlarged Fitbit. LOL.
"Same for me! Suddenly all other android smartwatches seems compelling. Also, the next Pixel watch insider testing has commenced recently! so looking forward for an official release"
I did an order the 8 classic
"I tend to think it's not worth $150. people like to do the math and say ""I only paid $150 for my watch."" ""I only paid $900 for my f0ls 7.""


As if trading in a watch 7 or fold 6 does not deprive you of a product that had utility or at the very least resale value.¬†


If you think about it that way would you spend $150 every year just to upgrade your watch.... After 4 years you've spent $600.... But your first watch probably could have survived the whole time¬†"
"yeah, same hardware"
"It looks great but I think they made it too nice. $500... At that point I think people will be more inclined to just get the ultra at that price point and get double the battery.¬†


¬†
I mean I think it looks beautiful but $500 price on what for Samsung is basically their mid-range watch....


Frankly I already think the Pixel watch in the Apple watch are absurdly overpriced. Especially since these devices are now so many generations in that you're just better off buying the older one.¬†


There is no way the Samsung classic 8 is $400 better than watch 6 classic, imo.¬†


I don't doubt it's a better watch. With some newer features like Gemini and whatnot. But I'd rather say 400 bucks and just use the old one for a couple years.¬†


But I think this is how you should probably buy phones in 2025 as well. S23 ultra can be grabbed for like 500 bucks"
"I also decided to get the 8 classic coming from the 3 classic. While I would've loved a fully black, circular watch, I'm really interested by all the new features since the 3. My 3 is also starting to struggle, so an upgrade was overdue."
I'm very sad that this does not have blood pressure monitoring cuz the watch3 had it and although it was not real accurate I really liked the fact that it had it this should have it too!
which one?
"I'm upgrading from my watch 6 classic, I played with the 8 classic at Best buy and it feels very snapy and responsive, I do enjoy the way it looks, I'm primarily upgrading due to my 6 classic battery life is not what it used to be. Plus T-Mobile is offering it to me for free. 

I did also see the watch ultra, personally I think it's not worth it."
Trade-ins would have to be spectacular I think to justify it.¬† Like if they're giving you 350 for it and then you're only having to pay $150 for the watch maybe then.... Even then. I would be inclined to just keep the watch for another year or two and then grab the watch¬† 8 classic in 2 years when it cost 30 cents on the dollar
"I mean this is getting downvoted but I know what you mean. Like in fairness sometimes I use My interest in consumer electronics is just a way to distract myself from the pitfall of misery that we live in with late stage capitalism¬†




But look... The real depressing part is what's going on with AI and how they're increasing CO2 emissions by 40 percent just to cool these servers.¬†¬†


Terrible for the environment, terrible for workers terrible for consumers"
"I snagged the 8 classic for $250, $200 trade-in discount, $50 pre-order discount + education discount"
I saw the 8 classic today. I was worried it may be too big and wanted to see it. The shop didn't have any standard watch 8's. Just classic. It looked really nice and classy which the previous ones I didnt find to be
Venu 3
"The best crazy Part is how poor children Nd women are being absolutely massacred for no reason what's so ever in Palestine. Like they literally doing what Hitler did, and no blinks an eyelid these days. Heartbreaking. 

But yeah technology is an avenue for us to move away from worries man, I wouldn't worry about it to much."
trade in was the 7 44mm which i got for free so it was whatever
I am not sure but I feel like the Chinese need to prove themselves more than Western Companies. They have to go above and beyond to earn the same respect as Apple though as they are not respected. They are considered cheap products. Another thing is software. Western companies have better software reliability and experience but this is becoming less of a thing as more companies offer more software support.
They are not. There software is so behind. Only thing that have is battery and samsung can do it too.
"Yeah..hard disagree.
Chinese phones software(if you can even call it that) is absolute dogshit.
Having a chinese phone with great hardware is like  driving a Ferrari on an extremely shitty road full of potholes.
No thanks. I'd rather have a great software experience  with long term support than over the top specs and no software."
"This comment section is full of ignorance. The only reason you are not getting chinese products in the US is because they wont let you for a myriad of reasons. But china has veen leading innovation on phones for a while now, cars pretty recently making amazing AFFORDABLE vehicles. It really sucks honestly. We are stuck with grossly expensive products that dont really improve year after year now because they dont need to since they own the market in the US at least."
"I've been using an Honor Magic V2 for a year and a half and it launched in China 2 years ago. It's got similar thickness, weight, and dimensions to the Fold 7 and a significantly bigger battery despite costing 30% less when new. Both screens are incredibly bright, chassis and hinge are titanium (not aluminum), currently runs Android 15 with a mostly bug-free beta of Android 16.

Keep in mind, this device launched 2 years ago. Anyone who thinks the Chinese aren't years ahead in foldables is just wrong. Their hardware is easy ahead and their software is only a half step down from OneUI. The Honor Magic V5 is thinner, lighter, cheaper, and has a much bigger battery than the Galaxy Fold 7."
Fold 7 is definitely 1-2 generations behind china ones. Sadly they don't sell in USA and imported ones have no support.
So Korea is China now?
"It is hard to say since most of the patents aren't chinese... is always distilled effort with china.

That said, build quality wise samsung is always better than chinese companies."
"I thought Samsung was Korean, not Chinese."
"Oh yeah, we've known it for years and it will always be this way until competition happens for them in the west again"
So far ahead in copying
"This is what you get with corrupt inefficient fat governments, inflation and high taxes, and crippling regulations."
"And this is mainly thanks to the US market for some reason... Everywhere outsde the US, Xiaomi, Poco, Redmi, Honor are respected phone brands. I see people bragging about the camera of the latest Vivo or Oppo, but I guess the market in the US is bigger somehow for Apple and Samsung. 

Also, I do love Samsung, but I feel stuck with the S23U, either because the S24-S25 aren't worth the upgrade and because my house is a Samsung Ecosystem, with TV, Minisplit, Watch, buds, fridge, etc, that getting another brand will feel like a downgrade to my everyday life and to change all that equipment will be way too expensive."
China also doesn't play by the same laws other countries do with intellectual properties... :D
"Earlier this week, Samsung [announced](https://www.wired.com/story/everything-samsung-announced-at-its-summer-galaxy-unpacked-event-july-2025/) the latest generation of its high-end foldable phones at its Summer Galaxy Unpacked event. The Galaxy Z Fold7 and the Galaxy Z Flip7 are variously lighter, thinner, less crease-prone than before. They are more expensive too. Some call them the ‚Äúfoldables to beat.‚Äù

It‚Äôs Samsung messaging and a commentator response that sounds an awful lot like what we heard last year. And the year before that, for that matter, in a hall of echoes typical of the iterative progress loop much of consumer tech hardware has fallen into. It's not that we think they'll be bad‚Äîwe liked their predecessors [just fine](https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-and-galaxy-z-flip6/). It's just that when you compare them to the progress being made by Chinese competitors, they feel a bit dull, and already a step behind in an area they are widely thought to lead.

Yes, calling the latest tech boring has a touch of The Simpsons' ‚ÄúOld Man Yells at Cloud‚Äù meme energy to it. But it‚Äôs symptomatic of a truth that could have serious implications further down the line for all of us: China is winning consumer tech, in a big way.

Pretty easy when all their tech was stolen from other companies that had been manufactured there cheaply
"Lol WTF is this paid propaganda bullshit article. 

Nobody F ing uses chine phones because they suck."
"Chinese phones are garbage

Just like this post"
Go home CCP.
"If you don't want Iphone, there is nothing else on the market other than Samsung. Until the china phone came to the 
market. I own a fold 4 because China folds was not available in my country. Sold it after one year because of the form factor is simply unusable without opening the inner screen. Now fold 7 is finally on ""par"" with the other folds in the market. Proper form factor, slim, and no gap. But still the same lousy battery and limited one year warranty. From fold 4 to fold 7, it took 2 to 3 years."
Wired is just another woke media like pcgamer
"It definitely a thing though. In the US everyone knows Samsung or Apple, they don't need to try to sell. But you say something about Poco phone and 90% of people will be like huh, what s that?"
"Imo, it's due to lack of or poor after sales support by them."
"They do go above and beyond...but I think that is because of how competitive the market is. With each of the six major players having about a 15 percent marketshare (Vivo, Oppo, Honor, Xaomi, Samsung, Apple) in China, they have to compete, or no one will buy their products.

The Western market is terrible. The three big players (Apple, Samsung, Google) are content to be anti-competitive and keep reusing the same batteries, camera sensors, screens, etc year after year while also gradually taking away useful functionality (while, at the same time, convincing their customers that removing a feature is a good thing).

This is why I strictly shop on the global market. I refuse to give any money to Apple, Samsung, or Google when they all share the same level of mediocrity in the smartphone space. I do not know what you mean by ""earning the same respect"" as Apple or Samsung. If anything, those brands have proven to do anything but listen to what their customers want. I expect the smartphone market in the West to look very similar to that in the East over the next few years if Samsung and Apple continue to ""play it safe"" by refusing to innovate. I would say your assumption that Chinese tech is ""cheap"" is completely unsubstantiated. Cheaper in cost to the consumer? Yes, but that is because Apple and Samsung inflate their prices arbitrarily, hoping their customers will just pay it. Eventually, people are going to wise up to their antics and start voting with their wallet. 

Typed on my Vivo x200 Pro in the USA."
"They'd have a much better shot here if their phones had all the bands we need in the US for networks other than T-Mobile.  I have a OnePlus and that's why.  I wanted the OnePlus open 2 but they didn't make it.  It instead would be the oppo n5 but I never bothered because it only fully supports T-Mobile here. OnePlus however does have all the bands required for Verizon, att, and T-Mobile. No mmwave however but that's still so rare to find unless you're in a city which I'm nowhere near so it's great for me."
Aren't those companies still using western (or open source) software in the form of Android? Or have they gone with their own OS?
Very American take.
"They need to prove themselves because they way too often just blatantly rip off other companies with their software with no effort to actually change it. Their hardware is good, but until they spend some more time with R&D they are not going to gain as much respect. I would be embarrassed to use phones like OnePlus because of things like their dynamic island ripoff. You can replicate good ideas without just entirely taking another companies design. Samsung very clearly replicated dynamic island, but put their own twist on it. If you asked most normal people, they probably wouldn't even know it was dynamic island inspired.

The global version of their phone is also significantly worse than the local version, which makes it tough for them to gain any respect outside of China or India."
"Coming from a software engineer, software is waaaaaaay easier to replicate than hardware or especially manufacturing processes.

If they closed the gap in hardware, they're only a couple competent software engineers away from closing the gap on software (that is assuming that the problem isn't leadership pushing boneheaded direction)"
All samsung phones are a 2 year glass cannon
"Hardware is well ahead. Software is android.

Don't pretend that one software skin on top of android is better than another. If the user can customize the skin to do what they want, then the skin really doesn't matter. Android is android and you can make it into what you want.

Samsung should be emabrassed for refusing to use SiC batteries, faster charging speeds, and better camera sensors. A 10mp telephoto in a $2k phone?!"
"I'm afraid you aren't correct. Most of the Chinese phones have at least fine/good software, with OnePlus, Xiaomi and Honor having great software. Sure, a budget Chinese phone won't have good software, or even hardware, but that is expected. I moved away from Samsung to xiaomi, because they aren't innovating as they used to. When Samsung fixes that problem, I will be the first customer to buy their phones!"
Build quality is also far behind. Doesn't matter how flashy your phone is when it's not going to even make it into the next year.
"The experience software provides is the primary distinguishing factor. Otherwise, the hardware in a person's hands is the same, it's just a rectangular slab. iPhone users don't switch because of the software, they don't care if it has a smaller battery, these minor spec differences mean nothing to the average user."
"And and will are 2 completely different words.

They've had over 3 years of the same battery and charging tech.

If we had 65W or 85W for the phone, then it really wouldn't matter with regards to battery size, but here we are.

And you can have the best OS in the world, but someone else will inevitably come and take that spot, at which point, you lean back on hardware, which Samsung can't."
Not even battery. People confuse choosing to not use a recent battery material with being unable to use it.
"My cousin has one of these Chinese phones (I can't recall the name). While the software is workable, it is not quite at the level of One UI. Yes, it has so many features that are mind-blowing in number(just that), but most of them are far better on Sammy.

A simple example he was like I can screenshot by sliding my 3 fingers on the screen, I was like Why would you want to do that(Yes Sammy has a similar one You can slide your hand palm from side to side it takes the screenshots) but I was like what if you could do it with one hand and only 2 taps away? He was like how?!
You can use Sammy's assistant floating button and just 2 taps to get a screenshot.
This was just a very small sample of how deep it goes."
"Their software isn't behind by development, it's only behind due to management which forces bloat in their OS. I'm sure their developers are more than capable of making a better OS"
"Have you actually tried Chinese phones? I doubt it, since most of them have software equal to or better than OneUI."
I have access to Chinese phones in Japan. I would not buy one. They are lower quality products. You can‚Äôt tell me the shitty OS that‚Äôs in a Xiaomi or Oppo is even in the same league as iOS or OneUI
"Oh yeah, really good cars...
My sister and uncle fell for that trick, now they have 2 ""new"", different Chinese EVs that need repairs - one at 8 months and one at 10ish..
The bloody window winders stopped working in my sisters too..

China is fantastic at making a product that looks good and looks quality, not a product that runs or lasts well, hence ""affordable""."
The reason they keep innovating on hardware is because they are locked out of US software if not they would've never had an incentive to innovate things like their triple foldables and stuff like that
"I actually posted this article before op did, and my topic was talking about why the article writer was incompetent because Samsung is a Korea based company not Chinese, and that post got no comments or attention because I just found out most people don't know that Samsung is a Korea based company, even in this subreddit, which is just sad."
OMG we finally found amber heard's lawyer's reddit! Just reading headlines instead of the article
It is
"Exactly, there's blatant patent and intellectual property theft cases it is easier for them to make phones when someone else already did all the hard work. 
Which is why is hard to copy Samsung OneUI and how polished it looks."
Old argument lol
Old argument lol.
Samsung has been called boring in the foldable and slab space for years now. The same people complaining for years about it have been highlighting chinese OEM's advancements. So I'm not sure what reality the writer is living in. The problem is availability (when it comes to the US) where chinese OEMs are all banned or blocked except for Lenovo and OnePlus.
Have you been living under a rock or are you just tech illiterate?
Low quality bait I'm afraid
Literally everyone uses a Chinese phone outside of the States.
That's your best comment? Such comments could only come from life's losers!¬†
All Chinese OEMs need is to establish strong relationships with phone carriers and they'll eventually start taking off. This was the route Apple and Samsung took to stand out as brand names to the average person here compared to other smartphones. Most people don't buy unlocked
I only know about these brands because I am curious to see what the news is. I prefer the software experience of Google but prefer the hardware of the Chinese. But with the fold 7 you get an in between. Wait for some sweet depreciation and you got a good deal in the second hand market.
"Well, there are way more brands in China, unlike the major two in the US. I can guarantee you that everyone knows Huawei and Xiaomi in China, not to mention a bit lesser but still moderate known brands like Oppo, Vivo, and Honor."
Xiaomi doesn't sell there. That's why 90% don't know about it lol. The other 10% import it.
"It doesn't really help that most chinese products are named by 6 year olds. 

Dooyee superultra plus phonescall true1

Samsung's market share in China is only around 1%...
">The three big players (Apple, Samsung, Google)

I wouldn't call the mobile phone market in the US a ""big three."" It's really Apple, Samsung, and everyone else. [Google's market share in the US](https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america) is a tick over 4% currently. Motorola is just under 4%. Apple is at 58% and Samsung is at 22%. It's those two and everyone else. Google is at the head of the ""everyone else"" group, but just barely."

"I was with you right up until ""a couple [of] competent software engineers"". 2 engineers ain't going to close the gap I'm afraid."
"China now is what Korea was in the 80s and 90s.

Korea started stealing engineers from large Japanese manufacturers by offering them huge sums of money. China is now doing the same with Korean engineers, and it's a huge contributor to the difficulties Sammy is having with their semiconductors. Among other factors."
"> closing the gap

Where is this gap? Android and iOS have become American devices biggest liabilities. The FBI has basically told the entire country to stop texting or clicking links on these devices because they're not secure.

American operating systems are designed for the needs of the management team running the company, not the end user. Apple keeps adding AI features that no one wants in ways that destroy and concept of privacy on the device. Microsoft is adding a feature that essentially turns Windows into NSO-group style spyware (windows recall). And at this point Android just seems like one giant backdoor.


""Our software is our advantage"" would have been true a couple decades ago but management of that infrastructure was taken from creative innovators like Steve Jobs and put in the hands of corporate hatchetmen like Tim Cook. Watching our tech companies try to interface with European markets should give you a hint about where America's tech debt is coming from. These countries are looking at these companies and apps and deciding that their core business models are illegal. America's corporate culture, and their predatory lobbying apparatus, have rendered our most powerful companies completely incompetent and rather than investing in their products and users they're simply pushing economic isolationism in order to protect their ill-gotten marketshare."
Apparently according to a Google engineer the silicon carbide batteries last 2-3 years less compared to lithium ion batteries. (From a recent MKBHD podcast)
">Don't pretend that one software skin on top of android is better than another. If the user can customize the skin to do what they want, then the skin really doesn't matter. Android is android and you can make it into what you want.

This is absolute bullshit.

I won't pretend one is better than the other, i know my preferences, and i know i prefer some over others.

No, you can barely customize most of them, oneui is exceptional in that area.

No, the user cannot customize it to do what they want. Again, oneui is much better in this area.

No, you cannot make android into what you want without changing the code."
"Yes. Samsung is blatantly choosing their older, inferior batteries. For some stupid reason."
"One UI is the ugliest OS. It lacks the modern look and feel of iOS, Pixel and even Chinese OSes."
Yup. I own the n5 which I'm trying to sell if your interested
Samsung is becoming stagnant hardware wise
"Yeah noone brags about a xiaominor oppo, i have gotten one too lmao. But id LOVE a huawei."
It‚Äôs paywalled.
Still accurate.
"Isn't that the point though, that Samsung feels it can lag behind because they can. There is no real competition at their level for Android in the US."
"Literally and factually wrong when it comes to Europe. Like, why even bother with an exaggerated, obvious and easily disproven lie like that?"
Because they‚Äôre poor as F and can‚Äôt afford nice phones from Samsung or Apple? üëÄ
"I thought they were banned in the US - or quasi-banned. 

I was using a Huawei P10 as my primary cell phone when they were banned ‚ò†Ô∏è

Anyhow, Americans have to get past a lot of propaganda AND have some degree of confidence in how the US government will treat phone manufacturer. I'm looking across to the drone industry and feeling concerned about DJI, for example."
"Is it that low?! I'm referencing this chart. I assumed ""others"" was a bug chunk of Samsung. Looks like I was mistaken https://imgur.com/a/I7wIUy7!"
Thanks. I didn't realize that. But it makes me happy! Smart people.
"Yeah, dealing with the big three can be a pain. I actually imported the Vivox200 pro online (AliExpress, took a few weeks), and I'm using it on T-Mobile. It works well enough, but not all the bands are supported, so coverage gets spotty sometimes. Definitely not as smooth as using a Samsung, but hey, sometimes you gotta try new things!"
I bought my Vivo brand new on ebay direct from a shop in India. I bought an Oppo for my spouse from wondamobile.com. We are on US Mobile. No issues. I've been using global variants on and off for years.
A few experienced software engineers make a big difference. Massive teams can still churn out garbage year after year.
"Wouldn't be worse by much if true. Samsung uses lithium polymer batteries in their foldables, not lithium ion."
"If true, Honor Magic Pro 5 users would be reporting it left and right."
"That's not correct. Good silicon carbon batteries have much better cycle life than traditional lithium batteries. Sometimes they are tested to about double the cycle life. Here is my Oppo Find X8 Pro phone after 7 months of heavy use since getting it on launch day

https://preview.redd.it/7ijm3eue6jcf1.jpeg?width=1264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3a588e539d6e9f7f3d513d613b688b221ec9d29"
Claim made. No evidence given.
"Folks are way too happy trigger with this. There are very good reasons for not jumping into a new battery tech with not enough data, and I for one am sitting out of any devices with carbon silicon until there's a bit more of a history. Don't get me wrong, though, I'm all for new tech and more battery capacity, and I'm happy you're so willing to test this for me. ;-)"
"That's very interesting, considering the general consensus is that ColorOS is a very likeable skin, particularly for foldables. Earlier builds were pretty rough (I used 6.1 for a while and hated it) but even ColorOS 11 was pretty decent on my A91, and ColorOS 15 is widely regarded as being a major selling point for Oppo devices. It's possible that they screwed something up for the Find N5, like they did with the X8 Ultra. I can't quite remember what they got wrong but there was an update for the X8U recently which broke something software wise.

You're definitely an outlier from what I've seen and heard when it comes to Chinese software. OriginOS in particular I have heard basically only praise for, and ColorOS isn't far behind."
I can read in full though. Both in the android webview and samsung browser. The whole thing. [This is the potato screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/e0M8Nsq.jpeg).
Not really
"I think it is more complex than that. I have no desire for lots of modern ""innovations"" and I am probably not the only one. I just want a phone that can call, text, run some apps, and take pictures. I don't need another computer. I have one. I suspect that this the case for lots of other people. I don't know anyone who has talked about a great new phone feature they want in years."
A Huawei is just as expensive as those 2
"DJI lost me when they started forcing you to update software or your drone would no longer fly. That makes it just too easy to push out a message that an update is available and then make it not possible to actually download thereby bricking all the drones using a particular country software variant - or, alternatively, pushing an update that now permits remote operation from elsewhere.

Would it happen? I hope not. But the possibility might be there."
They ain't so smart if Apple has sizeable share compared to their own.
This is why I haven't moved to a Chinese maker yet. The bands. What good is a super high tech phone if it can't send a text.
gaben approves your take

"Well, good luck making coloros look not like ios... 

enjoy ig

Also, i would like to point out that your claims don't have any evidence either, you hypocrite..."
"SiC has been the standard now for what, 3 generations? Is that not enough time?

Samsung is just being stubborn. There is no reason for a device to be charging at 25w or be limited 4400mah when the competition is 90w and 5800mah."
I don't know how Wired decides whether to paywall someone but what a clickbait.
"As others have mentioned, we're not talking about adding gimmicks to the phone to compete. Were talking about lagging behind in key/core features. Thinness, battery, etc. If you are going to remove features like the digitizer to compete in thickness, but your competitors keep it in and are thinner, then what is the true reason you are removing it. Well it saves them a lot of money. Its true that Samsung is way ahead with their version of Android, it's a great reason to stick with them, but I think it is fair to feel like they are playing the game a bit when it comes to hardware. Could they go all out, add better specs, better camera, without raising prices, probably, but that would hurt their bottom line. That's all it comes down to at the end of the day"
"One of the only things that made Samsung finally improve on the boring 12 Mp main camera that they used for years and years was the world wide availability and hype around the Huawei Mate20 Pro cameras. The phone was exciting, the back of the phone was beautiful, the camera software really really good. And their follow on announcements made it very clear they would continue to innovate at a rate that would push Samsung and Apple to wake up and start working to keep their places in the market.

If Huawei had not made a commercial decision to contravene the USA rule about dealing with USA-prohibited countries being a barrier to the USA market and companies, a lot of us would likely either be using Huawei phones now or we would now be holding much better Samsung and Apple phones. It was their right to choose who to deal with and they knew the downside. They probably figured at worst a few years and then a few hundred million in fines because they had watched what happened to ZTE. They were wrong. Perhaps because they went to such lengths to hide the financial transactions. Who knows? 

At any rate, I think smart phone innovation has been worse off for their absence."
Yes that‚Äôs y nobody buys it because you‚Äôd rather buy Samsung or Apple for the same price.
Yeah - it‚Äôs so riskyüò≠
"Try doing the math. It hasn't lost a single percent of estimated capacity over 7 months. You can also easily find info online about tests done to show silicone carbon batteries last 50-100% more cycle life than traditional graphite-based batteries.

""In OPPO‚Äôs latest laboratory test results, we‚Äôve found that the Battery Health Engine is able to keep a battery at 80% of its original capacity after as many as 1,600 charge cycles. This effectively doubled the lifespan of batteries under current industrial standards.""

You are the one claiming software skins aren't customizable. Don't pretend that android isn't what you make of it.
"That bearly means 3 years. In some manufacturers, it could mean only a year and a half."
Is it ragebait ? Has to be or it would be really cringe
"Even lower quality bait I'm afraid. I know you want to reply but unfortunately you're not worth my time 

*Does a 360 and walks away towards my Nintendo switch console* heh nothing personal."
And you are the one claiming they are. Don't pretend they are.
Because they are....still waiting on something you want to customize that you claim can't be done.
"Unlock the fucken bootloader on Huawei, Xiaomi, Realme, and Oppo.
All you said goes to show you know nothing about how Android and in general a mobile os works."
And Samsung is going to lock the bootloader soon on all models with One UI 8 lol.
lol google is probably getting more money from samsung than their own pixel
Aaaannnnd this is why I switched away from Google. Getting real tired of them half assing absolutely everything regarding pixels. Couldn't be happier with my 25 edge.
I'm not buying anymore smart watches. i only use it for the time. 99% of the other features never get used
That's exactly why they treat their products like that.
Software updates are literally why I switched TO Google... I'm really surprised they'd pull something like this
And they wonder why people stay loyal to apple. How the fuck google don‚Äôt prioritize their own watch over another company? They didn‚Äôt even mention when it will be available on pixel watches i don‚Äôt have pixel products but if i was using one and see something like this i‚Äôd switch instantly and this isn‚Äôt their first time doing things like this reading them on the news makes non pixel owners not even thinking about buying from them
Actually it's no surprise to me. They are always all over Samsungs nuts.
"Sick of ""Google working on said feature, but it's coming at a later date"" and it's a feature that Samsung and Apple already have."
"I did lol, Legit halfway through the Samsung Unpacked I got an S25 Edge."
"It's because Google needs Samsung especially for smart watches. Google had to get Samsung involved and on board to revive the wearos platform. 

Samsung has a hand in developing wear OS now so it isn't out of the ordinary that they are getting the update first."
"Still, I feel like copying code to upstream is harder than writing it upstream then merging downstream, because of all the Samsung UI customizations that has to be a nightmare"
"Running One UI 8 on S25 ultra. Still same processing. No difference in the moving shots, always blurry."
Would like to know this as well.
is the zfold 7 comming with one UI 8?
Still no blood pressure in the USA
"I was just harassed into updating to UI 7, and now my battery is draining like crazy.

Can I roll it back?"
"Darn it. I don't know if I can get back to the Z with a camera that struggles to take photos of kids...

Thank you for the info!"
[Yup.](https://i.imgur.com/NW61j8T.jpeg)
I don't think so
Samsung seems to be complacent in their cameras and battery tech. It used to be the leading innovator in the Android space.
"In terms of capacity, it loses slightly, but in terms of durability. It could charge up to 2000 times before reaching 80% of the original capacity, whereas the usual competitors only could achieve up to 1000 times. So, in overall capacity of the battery lifetime, Samsung still wins."
"Also, I had the ZF6 for a while, and personally I found the battery life to be great, even during tough conditions like very long trips."
"I'm not looking at brads, only products. So I've had Motorola, 3x Xiaomi, 2 Samsung phones. None of them showed significant battery degradation after 3+ years. To this day I have Xiaomi Mi9 as spare, phone looks and works like new. So no.. it depends how You are using it.   
And ilicon-carbon battery are expected to last more cycles on top of higher power density.   


For now I can say one thing. My Xioami Mi11 felt 2' smaller in hand compared to S23 Ultra. Display was another class. That was first and big downgrade after getting  Samsung. Funny is that, that was Samsung display too.."
"Good for you then, my Mi 10 and my friend's Mi 10 and 13 all died in less than 2 years. Both are loss in battery degradation. No gaming, light usage, normal 30% to 80% charging, battery health left 70% in 2 years, what a godlike battery performance. 

For us, we are not getting back to Xiaomi, good to try other brands but not Xiaomi anymore. Even my 6 years old Honor still have 94% battery health, same period as my main and then as my backup rhythm gaming phone."
Been using this for a week on my old ultra
interesting
"Pretty much everything.

It's the primary way I interact with my phone."
Quick notes without unlocking the phone. Flexing media controls through air actions and smart selecting text from pictures etc to copy and paste.
"Taking group photos, and occasionally when I need to draw/sign something small"
everything else than gaming or checking messages
"I use it for handwriting with Samsung keyboard. Unfortunately I prefer my SwiftKey keyboard for typing.

I wish there could be a routine that detects when my pen is detected and allows me to automatically switch keyboard..."
"Nothing really. I always forget about it until I read a post like this. I will then pull it out and scribble around for a few minutes, and then put it back and forget about it until the next post like this."
"I use it for almost everything from scrolling through websites to signing documents which I do a lot. I use my phone more for work tasks when I'm away from the office or when I just don't feel like firing up my laptop. It's so much easier to open a document make edits, save and/or send it to someone using my phone than to print it out, make edits, scan it, then send it or save it. The S Pen is the only reason I have stayed with Samsung since the Note line started. I can see why some don't use it but for some of us it's the primary reason to buy an ultra or fold device."
There's an S-Pen?
"I don't, it's a pain in the tail."
Making memes and taking pics
"I use it for taking selfies.  
it has no other value for me, at all."
Sniffing
It helps keep lint from getting into the spen slot
"My kid likes to doodle with it. 

  
For the s24 it was cool to be able to take group photos with it, but we lost that with the s25. 

  
I also like to use it to take notes during meetings. 

  
Though I do miss the take photos feature from the s24, I like that now you can use kindle or remarkable sylis to take notes. The bigger form factor feels a lot better in my hands for long note sessions."
"One thing among others - I can select ""Desktop mode"" on web browser, and interact with big screen GUIs without zooming in."
I take it out for a whiff so I can get energized for the day
I used to draw with S-pen and take meeting notes. It was such a useful feature. It's a real shame the lastest model did away with the S-pen.
"Taking notes and drawing sketches. ""OK, but what does the bolt go into?""

I need a way to get a stylus or an s pen to connect with a non-s pen samsung Android tablet."
"I'm going through my university classes with nothing but my phone and spen


Also for shooting and showing photos #ihavebluetooth"
"Mainly for trolling my friends lol...

  
Like if they say something stupid, I'll draw a circle of trust, put a dot on the outside of it and add their name."
I use like smelling salts
tf? are you trolling or for real?
"Do u think does It worth to repair my phone? I have a s24 ultra but spen cannot connect fo device, I bought a new one but didn't connect either"
I have owned this phone for 5 months and recently discovered the S pen üòÖ
"Not trolling.

The S-Pen was a major reason why I moved over to the Note line with the Note 8.

I'm someone who's used to taking notes, so holding the S-Pen just feels natural to me.

I've gotten very proficient at swype typing with my S-Pen to few point that it feels weird not using it."
"tbh, for me, the spen never felt like a real pen/pencil. It didn't gave me a full writing experience, one because my phone feels too smal for a spen and maybe the screen protector I've put on also makes my spen work worse."
"It can be screen protector. Remember some time ago saw post about changing S-Pen tip to other compatible brand, with higher resistance."
So the fold is $2k‚Ä¶ how high does the tri fold go.
Then they gonna have the Origami phones üòé
"They'll bring back S-Pen support as an incentive. Like clockwork - They take stuff away, see who complains, and then resell it back to you if it garners enough negativity."
Tri-fold like the Huawei Mate XT tri-fold? Because while I like and have no issues with my Flip 5 (and had no issues with the Flip 3 before it) it'll take a lot to convince me that having a folding screen on the outside of a device is a good idea.
They are saying nothing on availability which sucks guess I‚Äôll wait.
"Why would anyone want a trifold? 

Just get an iPad and a phone, separately."
¬£2.5k-¬£3k phone that will likely break within a year..... I like the progress this niche is making but at the same time I'm sick of being an alpha/beta tester and paying for the privilege to do so.
for only 3500 bucks what a deal!!!!!
When one crease in your screen isn't enough.
"Trifold is so unnecessary, _to me_."
I'll buy it when they make a ten-fold !
"I already find the fold pretty big, I can't imagine how huge a trifold will be."
Well do they want me to buy a Fold 7 or not then? Why would I get one if this is coming out right after?
"Shouldn't be dual fold!

![gif](giphy|gEvab1ilmJjA82FaSV|downsized)"
Probably has a 3000mAh battery and 15w charging
Expect Defects on DAY ONE
"Oh great, I'm sure fold owners were getting sick of only their phones breaking in absurd amounts."
literally name one person that asked for rhat
Tri = 3k?
"I‚Äôd be surprised if they do. Having three segments, they‚Äôll need each part to be as thin as possible and they‚Äôve already removed the digitizer for the regular Fold to ensure thinness."
It will be G fold factor
It'll have a cover display and fold inwards. So not like the Mate XT.
That's the point - a proper sized iPad that can fold up to fit in your pocket.
"Why don't YOU want a tri-fold phone? One device to rule them all.. Apple can suck my dingus, too. Hate their software. Non-intuitive garbage code."
I'm replying to this on my Fold 2 phone right now. 5 years and going now. Just saying...
Then it‚Äôs not for you. Other people may want one. Why are people trying to gate keep phones?
30% bigger?
"Maybe, just maybe, some people don‚Äôt want a trifold. They just want the Fold 7. Price is a factor as well. I know it‚Äôs a radical thought, but just think about it."
You're being optimistic. 1000mah and 5w charging
Still using my Fold 2!
Me
Each foldable side is 1k.
The only answer! Lol..
"That layer is so thin it doesn't matter, is the s25u thicker than other phones? It has the digitiser and the spen inside."
It would be extremely fragile.
"Congrats dude üëçüëç nice to hear someone having a good experience. Most of the voices tend to be ""my 1 year old fold's screen just died/got a dead pixel....etc""

Super happy yours is still going üéâ"
Same here. Fold 2 still going strong except that the battery isn't the best anymore and it doesn't fully open flat anymore
Fixed it for you. BYE.
[deleted]
"It does matter in foldable phones, since the thickness of the layer becomes double."
"Only if you can't take care of your equipment,  I say. Hell, I still have my Atari 2600 from the 70s and it still works. Not be a dumbest amd treat your stuff with some respect and it will last forever."
That‚Äôs actually a fair statement now. Ciao.
You are correct. My math was not mathing. 1 more of 2 is indeed 50%.
Not at all
Does your Atari fold tho?
"If I get angry enough, yes."
So it's basically half as good as the S24u cam?¬†

No S Pen? Weaker battery than the Ultra?
"2 grand thou? Bro I could buy a Mac book for that. I just don't get the pricing on these things. Camera, durability, and just honestly full screen, scaling our problems here that have never been addressed on these foldable‚Äôs."
Am I the only one who thinks it defeats the purpose to slim a phone down when you still have camera bumps? Why can't we work towards recessed cameras so I dont catch my new slim phone on my pockets when sliding it in.
No. It's needs s-pen support. Why would you not want that on this big of a screen? It's one of the things that set Samsung apart. I guess I'll hold on to the Fold 6. Maybe by the time I need a new one someone will offer the pen support with folds again.
"People:  ""We want a bigger battery! You can even make the next model slightly thicker if needed!""

Samsung: ""Since you asked for a thinner phone, here's our new model, even thinner, with the same minuscule battery!""

  
How can you be so out of touch with your userbase?"
"Why did they add the hole in the display again. The front camera is not needed on a foldable, now they ruined the big screen without distractions."
"If there's no S Pen, what's the difference between this vs other brands?"
"This is really interesting to me, Samsung S series line became popular due to it being a spiritual replacement for a black berry.


They leaned into this up until the S5. It had a replaceable battery, and a high bandwidth data port for file management. It turned out, consumers liked the black berry look more for the aesthetic of being high business, not the actual functionality of that class (similar to ford F150s being used to haul groceries). 


So Samsung pivoted with the s6, but still supported the note line up. When people walked into a store and saw a Samsung phone. The first one they always pivot to, was the note line up, not because of its big screen, but because of its pen. Were they note-takers? No, but they liked the aesthetic of one, so they get the closest thing to that, which is the S line. This continues throughout the ultra line, and with the foldables. Samsung removes things like headphone ports, removable batteries, IR sensors so on; but they keep the s-pen and even add dex. Because someone there knew how vital it was to the appearance of the brand. 


Now with this most recent one, they remove the s-pen. Did people use it? Sure some Artists, Beauty Influencers, Accountants, Small businesses, Healthcare, Students, etc, but majority of the user-base didn‚Äôt. 


Some people in Samsung wanted to make the phone slimmer, looked at the data, and sacrificed the digitizer.  It seems someone somewhere forgot or maybe does not know why people chose Samsung over any other Brand. 


What confuses me, is why now? Why do it when AI workflows and tools are about to make precise lassoing and sketched diagrams useful again to the common person. The timing seems incredibly strange. It seems like they should lean into it once more, not away from it. 


I can‚Äôt help but feel they‚Äôre making a mistake that will be have effects much larger negative effects than anyone would have expected, but I guess we‚Äôll see where this takes them in the next couple years. After all they have more data than any of us."
comparing it to a zfold 3 is wild
[deleted]
"Maybe dropping the S Pen makes their phones thinner but it will certainly keep my wallet thicker cos I ain't supporting a company crapping on a loyal stylus customer base they have been building for over a decade, just to boost generic appeal."
"A piece of paper is very light and thin. It doesnt mean its good.
Small battery. Two bad one good camera. 
Honestly honor magic v5 is better"
This is not an upgrade.
"Seriously, where's the S Pen support? This is supposed to be a professional phone for business owners, artists or students, right? And what's up with the removal of the under display camera? It looks REALLY janky.

Personally, I don't mind if it's a little chunky (like the Zfold3), as long as it has more features (like a bigger battery). And for two grand, it better have everything. No cutting corners."
These look wayyy nice!
"The next generation will probably be the one to get. New battery tech and a sleek design.

I'm actually very interested in the next generation of the Edge, Flip, and Fold.

If Samsung releases an S26 Edge Mini with new battery tech, I'll stop postponing the upgrade and buy one a year after launch, at half the launch price, obviously."
"Same 12MP Ultra wide
Same 10MP telephoto
Same 4400mAh battery
Same 25W charging
Same IP48 durability
Same 2600 Nits brightness"
"No s pen... Huge camera bump and a plastic screen that can scratch unless you somehow live in a completely dustfree environment, never save or place your phone on places where there's debris and also keep it away from your nails... Nah"
Very clearly not thinner than the fold 6 when you look at the camera lenses
Still no silicon carbon batteries üëé
"No S pen, no hidden inner camera = I'm looking elsewhere. Don't remove utility."
"What is the fad for thin phones? Genuinely, what is the appeal?"
"If the Samsung Fold 7 had just these three things, no one would‚Äôve been able to resist buying it:

1. Under-display camera ‚Äì Since it's mostly used for video calls, even average quality would‚Äôve been fine.


2. S Pen support ‚Äì Seriously, why did Samsung remove this? It was one of the most useful features, and its removal is a major deal-breaker. Even if the phone got a bit thicker, it would've been worth it.


3. Titanium frame ‚Äì This one‚Äôs optional, but it would‚Äôve made the device stronger and lighter, which is always a plus.



If Samsung had included these, trust me, people would‚Äôve bought it without a second thought. Samsung makes such amazing phones, no doubt about it."
"that shit isn't thin.

still has massive camera housings, no one ever points that out.

cant be laid flat, these folds can't be packed full of so much magical tech that they cant make the camera flush with the body, its ridiculous at this point."
"I have ‚Ç¨600 off the Fold 7, I don't know if it's worth it"
I still wonder who are these people that want thinner phones. They just ran out of things to change to justify selling a new device.
Are they just ignoring the fact the cameras stick out miles?
More expensive than ever.
Thanks I'll get a oneplus lol
"Lol crazy, pass"
I mean it ain't thinner with the camera bump. False advertising if you ask me.
Well they dare not compare it with honor magic V5 atleast in terms of hardware alone üòÇ
Dude they just glued together 2 s25 edges
"For the longest time, I've been waiting to upgrade to the new fold when Samsung finally decided to make a housing for the s-pen in the device. This drop in s-pen support is pretty disappointing imo but I'm at least glad that their phones depreciate significantly so I can just get the fold 6 at a decent price. Oh well"
"\#want  
This will make me ditch my iPhone."
The only premium about this phone is the price
"Just when I decided to get a fold phone thinking Samsung finally figured it out they drop this. 

Guess we're paying for aesthetics at this point."
"Best phone this gen , haters gonna hate , potatoes gonna potate."
"There are a few flaws like battery and camera bump but man when I went to the store today and held the device, it feels and looks amazing. My last fold was the fold 4 and I‚Äôm currently on the z flip 6 & the 13 pro max. I‚Äôm gonna get rid of my flip but I‚Äôm not sure if I should go for this or the 25U."
Worse specs then a flagship
"Why is everyone hating? This is the first foldable in the American market that actually resembles a traditional slab form factor. Foldables need to be a no comprise alternative to regular phones, not to power users who want the best batteries and cameras."
"Saw it in a Samsung store today. It is so good. Cover screen is more usable, and internal screen is bigger. Feels so right in a hand. But the price... 4x from Z Fold 5 I've bought last week."
16 gig of ram for the terabyte model...
So excited to see the jerryrig bend test on this one.  Can see the thinness becoming a real issue.
"Gotta love the ""thin"" lie while the Camera Bump becomes a worse abomination with every generation."
I was hoping the new Fold would finally be worth it and I could upgrade my S23U to a Fold again since the last time I had a fold was the Fold 3 but NOPE yet again not worth it I am getting tired of Apple I mean Samsung and their stupid refreshes.
"No spen, small ass battery (when will they finally evolve on that btw ?)"
"Are we looking at the same picture? With the cameras, it's thicker than the last one... no S Pen and that battery??? Im really in the mood to buy a new phone. Samsung is not giving me a single reason to get rid of my S24U. At this rate, I should just buy another one and keep it in the box so when this one wears out, I still have a beast of a phone to use. The S25 was a complete flop, so I decided I was just going to wait and move to the foldable phones. Now the fold 7 is mediocre at best. What is going on at Samsung??"
Flip 7 FE has same specs as Flip 6 except for the processor change.
Say what you will but those big ass cameras make it thicker than the previous model.
"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's, oh, a Fold..."
Dunno if that's a good thing. My s25 is a tank.
"I think I will keep my fold 5 or upgrade to fold 6 because, at least, you still get s-pen support"
2k for that thing.
"I see Flip as a better deal. Exynos won't generate sales, prices come down, battery improved and looks good."
The S Ultra Phones will always be better than the foldables.
Will it survive jerryrig bend test?
"Im not impressed tbh, I don't need a slimmer phone, I need a bigger battery and all of the cameras to be the same as the S ultra - yes the 200mp is welcome to the fold 7, but the telephoto and wide were features I used on my s23 and I miss it daily. 
Why get rid of the S pen, surely that would benefit the bigger screen. 

The majority of everything else is software. 

I will have to wait and see what comes along."
Still bullshit
"Woooooow


Who cares really¬†"
The inside camera notch is enormous.
But is it thinner than the Oppo Honor Magic V5?
Hey at least they upgraded the 1TB to 16GB ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è now they need to do that with the S26 Ultra...
Can we not let phone manufacturers pull off its thinner? Can they include the height of the cameras?
"No spen, crap battery, I dont care how thin and light it is im going to put a case on it anyway.

I'd vastly prefer it had kept the thickness of my fold5 but had a chonking great battery.

Also not keen on a punch out for the selfie camera that surely nobody cares about. If I ever want a good selfie photo I flip the phone around and use the main camera and use the front display as the viewfinder. The new camera is obviously still worse than the main camera so what was the point?"
They should have just made a fold 6 but bigger and a newer CPU. That wobbly camera would piss me off.
"NO UDC inside!

![gif](giphy|U1aN4HTfJ2SmgB2BBK)"
Crazy to think that this phone folded is thinner than the iPhone 5C
I just want the z fold 6 but it's nowhere to be found‚òπÔ∏è
"Regarding the device's design, the absence of an S Pen and the battery capacity are significant drawbacks. While the emphasis on a thin and lightweight profile is appreciated, the practical application of a protective case negates this advantage.

A preference for a thicker design, similar to the Fold5, with an enhanced battery capacity is noted.

Furthermore, the integration of a punch-hole selfie camera is viewed as a less desirable feature, given the user's preference for utilizing the primary camera and front display for selfie photography. The perceived disparity in quality between the selfie camera and the primary camera further diminishes the value of this feature."
The only kind of thin phones that people want.
People talking about the price of 2k note that there is a more affordable option the flip and also the flip FE or the last gen flip for the people who want to try fold screen phones. The fold has always been the phone with a pricey tag and people who buy these phones have enough money that buying a 2k MacBook or any other thing over to this justifies. People who seek value and compare that in this price we can get any other device which has more purpose I get it. But the fold doesn't work that way. Most of the people I've seen using the fold have enough money that they can buy another one if this one breaks. Also I'm not defending Samsung for the telephoto and the smaller battery. Those two things really holds this phone back for more people
I hope it flops hard. This just aint what the people want.
"As long as it doesn't get an s pen slot, I'll be happy."
"I'm bloody excited for these foldables along with new watch. Currently I am on s25, will get a fold once launched."
Its also made in aluminum. No titanium. Frame could bend easier. And easier the thinner it is.
"I was so excited for a thin fold with a bigger screen, but the thing I use it for most is notetaking with the S Pen. Literally useless without the S pen. I have an iPhone for everything else and there is not a single thing the fold does better if not for the S pen.

Cameras? Still crap. Battery? Still small. Wobble? Like a rocking horse. Max uncropped video size? Still smaller than a large bar phone.

Hot take: they should've kept the under-screen camera on the inside. Rarely use that and much rather an uninterrupted screen. For zoom calls in a pinch it's always been fine. Who the fuck takes selfies with an unfolded fold."
"Samsung do make exclusive foldable devices for the Chinese market, specifically branded as the ""W series"".¬†These are essentially special editions of the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip, tailored to local tastes with design and feature adjustments.¬†For example, the W25 (a special edition Z Fold 6) features a ceramic back and golden accents, aligning with Chinese preferences for luxury aesthetics.¬†(so unfair man they had thinner folds for years from samsung over there)"
Apples better lol.
"Say it louder for the folks in the back! 

Slow charging, only one upgraded camera, no anti-glare front screen."
And worse camera bumps.
BUT IT IS THIN
"I was waiting for integrated spen in the folds to actually care

I wasn't going to carry around a separate pen or use a weird case to hold one

A larger screen would make really good use of the pen 

Then they dropped it because instead of innovating in features, they are trying to be thin. I guess s25u is my last Samsung as the s26u looks like such a minor upgrade from the leaks and they are eventually going to drop spen all together."
"Why oh why Samsung would you deprive what many (most?) believe to be among the greatest features of this device series!??!

The device is beautiful by all other metrics but the lack of S Pen compatibility is a major deal breaker for me and many other users I know. 

The former CTO for Samsung is a customer of mine in a completely unrelated field. I'm surely going to ask his thoughts but am also wondering, simply, why? The Z Fold series is a quasi-tablet and every tablet has digitization abilities with stylus (to my knowledge) so who fell asleep at the wheel here? Obviously nobody, Samsung is a powerhouse brand who I have to believe debated this feature immensely before design decisions were finalized, but what do I know?

Can anyone make sense of this? And before doing so, I get a long just fine using a case with integral pen slot for my Z Fold 5 and would simply do the same here (in other words, no need for an S Pen slot within the device itself)...

I feel like you're giving us the frankfurter without the roll!

And what else may be coming down the pipeline to bridge the gap for folks like us who rely on the S Pen so greatly?

"2 grand? Holy shit, i was thinking to buy it. Safe to say im out. I'll stick with my ultra"
You aren't paying for the hardware but for the R&D
"In the US most people aren‚Äôt paying cash for a phone, so the sticker price is meaningless"
I agree. the thickness of the phone is the thickness of its thickest measurement. I dont care if the camera bumps are an insignificant % of it.  they need to work on insetting the camera tech through the pcb or something.
"agreed, though it at least lets it be slimmer when using a case since the cameras will be cut out anyways, but those bumbps are WAY too big."
How does it defeat the purpose? Do you hold your phone by the body or the camera lense? A thinner body means less weight and more reach across the screen.
"They could just take the camera out,  or you could just get a different phone."
"IDK I've been using my phone with a case for years, the only time when I didn't was because of overheating, since the phone on the post cost alot, I assumed that the people who'd spend +‚Ç¨999 on a phone would protect it from external damage as much as possible."
Physics don't work that way
The purpose of this phone is not to be thin. It's a requirement for it not be too thick when closed. Also how do you want to put cameras inside a body this thin without them being complete crap?
"If people want larger camera sensors, that's the tradeoff."
"i would prefer a thick phone, with a massive battery and no camera bump over a very slim phone, with barely a battery and a massive camera bump"
"Folds used to come with s pens, and now they don't? 

Seems like a pen would be useful on a bigger screen like this"
"S pen is useless for most people, had one for my fold6 and never used it"
"Blame the tech reviewers, every single one was slamming Samsung last year that the Fold 6 was like twice as thick as the competition."
i had my credit card in hand ready to buy until I saw that tbh
Patent dispute
"Exactly.
They are slowly killing their unique appeal that helped build a loyal customer base, just to chase generic appeal."
"With the removal of the SPen there is no competitive difference. Software is software, and now there's no reason to consider it above the competition. I can't wait for Apple to announce Apple Pencil compatibility for their fold in a few years and make Samsung backtrack on the SPen removal"
"In my experience, samsung still has the best multitasking software by far. It still sucks not having s pen though."
Name recognition
I mean most people upgrade either every year or every 3-4 years so it may be a handy comparison for the second group
"Most people don't upgrade every year, so comparing it with a Z fold 3 makes sense, coming from a 5 year old midrange phone, it would make sense for someone like me to upgrade than someone with a previous gen model, especially now that phones are getting marginal upgrades."
"Gotta normalize not upgrading year! (Ideally, every couple of years)"
"To you it is, I used an S Pen for like 5 minutes then, I never used it again I would rather the Spen space be used for a slightly bigger battery."
That stylus base is a small minority which they felt ain't enough to keep it ü§∑üèæ can't blame them for removing and saving money over a feature that is rarely used
"Supposedly you're the minority, but they probably may not know that you're also the aesthetic. Removing the S Pen removes the aesthetic, making it go from high class business person to phone addict doom scrolling.


I feel as if it will ruin the reputation of the brand when it starts to become associated with the latter rather than the former.... but what do I know."
Not the same ultrawide.
"I don't care about the frame, but removing the S Pen and the UDC is genuinely absurd. Those were the features setting the Galaxy Folds apart from the competition, now the Fold 7 us just another foldable with nothing interesting to offer"
Tell me you never took a materials engineering class without telling me on point 3
How so?
I'll take a thinner phone
Same thickness as fold 6
"I don't think there's a workaround for that though. 

You need to add the depth you removed from the body to somewhere for the cameras."
It's actually smaller even at the bump
[removed]
What phone from Apple folds?
"The ultrawide gained autofocus, so technically two."
3 upgraded cameras
"The front screen is plastic, can't make that anti-glare, really."
"I've been using my Oppo Reno 2 for 5 years and never had an issue with the charging, is slow charging a big deal nowadays?"
and on top of all that. the fold still doesnt have a real screen. I don't like the fold and flex screen feel. feels like plastic. my ultra feels like GLASS
Isn't the ultrawide an upgrade kinda? Has autofocus now. No shitty 4MP selfie camera under the inner display either.
Oh true true. Is that what they wanted us to do honestly? They wanted us to be like oh but it looked prettier that mean I want.
"Dropping the spen would be such a backward step but at this stage, they are continuing to drive their mantra of Pay More For Less."
I genuinely find it frustrating that I have to compromise a step forward depending on which product I choose. Like I have the ultra because I need the pen I use it on a regular basis and even use it for work-related tasks. I'd love to not have to use a tablet at work and just use my phone and have it fold out but guess what I can't be caring another S pen not to mention they dropped support for it. Why do we not have a fold Ultra that just has all of the features I don't care how big it is I don't care how expensive it is just give me the device.
"Not gonna lie, I saw this pop up on my notifications and thought it was disagreeing at first but absolutely. The fold should be a match made in heaven for the S Pen. Limiting a device like this is unbelievable. It's more like the roll without the frankfurter at this point. There is absolutely nothing about the fold that would make me want to switch from my ultra."
"That's a BS excuse and reason. It doesn't even have S Pen support which means the software doesn't permit an external s pen. So no, you're incorrect it has nothing to do with size. They could do it, they're choosing to make it a niche product"
Consumers don‚Äôt care about that.  They will make their money back on RnD and the price won‚Äôt magically drop.
R&D for a device that‚Äôs 3 years behind the competition of devices that cost less.
R&D?
Or make the rest of the phone thicker to match and give us a 30% bump in battery life or something.
I think they totally do it this way because of most people using cases. They can just bulge the cameras out.
I'll probably get hate but I don't use phone cases due to the bulk it adds. It's why I push for phone manufacturers to go back to the days of no large bumps. Cases shouldn't be a solution since they're creating a problem to sell the solution.
"I don't use phone cases as they add extra bulk. Phones shouldn't be designed with a camera bump with the excuse of a case fixing the issue. As a right-handed individual the bumps do rest on my fingers when I hold my phone. When I put it down it causes a wobble which has veen a complaint from multiple people since ethey started doing camera bumps.

A size reduction isn't just about weight as comfortability in a hand is also a factor. Additionally more reach across a screen does not intrinsically apply with a thinner device as the overall width and length usually stay similar."
How many newer devices don't have a camera bump that run latest Android OS in the USA? Cause all I ever see is phones with bumps.
" Never understood people that argued *against* options they chose not to use but don‚Äôt change their experience simply by existing. 

Why do you care.  Is this years model cheaper because of it?"
"How dare they give us more options

I never use the front camera so you'll be fine with them removing it?"
It was one of the few things that separated the product from the rest. 'You' don't use it. But some of do for business. This product makes more sense than anything else they make to have the capability.
Can you elaborate further?
Worth noting this is speculation. I'm hoping to sit down and read through the documents at some point.
"I think you overestimate the amount of people that care about the S Pen.

Here you see a lot of people that are passionate about it, the general public however hardly uses it. I've met someone that didn't even realise they had one in their Ultra until I pointed it out.

Samsung realises this and is just cutting costs/increasing profit by dropping it, just like the downgrade of the Pen in the 25 Ultra didn't impact their sales numbers much this won't deter most of their loyal customers either, for most it's just a gimmick at best."
"There software is great but each time they launch a new product, they manage to nuke a feature. 

If they keep going, I will look into other brands because they've failed to offer something worth considering.  Sick of having to compromise on something. They are going backwards not forwards."
"Didn't previous iterations only have spen support for the inside screen only? While it makes sense if you're an artist, it's a bit inconvenient if you just want to jot down a note.¬†"
It has the same battery size tho
"But support for it was hoped. Maybe an accessory to buy and use a case to carry it. They aren‚Äôt using a layer on the screen to cut down thickness, but it takes away that pen ability"
"Funnily enough, both of you have good points... Is there an alternative to have a fully functional S Pen out of the phone and use it wherever you feel like it?"
But do the savings go to the consumer?
"They have literally made it their unique signature feature and have built a chunk of loyal customers using it for over a decade! These customers often are deep into the ecosystem, so losing one, loses them sales on tablets, watches etc.

It's about brand loyalty and marketing. By your logic the Foldables should go cos only a small fraction of people buy them. Heck, why not start removing the dialler since not many people make phone calls these days!

Snubbing loyal customers to chase generic trends might boost sales in the short term, but will hurt them massively in the long term. Ignoring a loyal customer base negatively impacts brand identity and a company such as Samsung should know better to respect that. Sadly, short-term shareholder greed always runs the show these days."
"Well why buy Samsung when other foldables are just as thin but with better battery and cameras 

The spen made them stand out, I was waiting for an integrated spen before I thought about foldables from Samsung now that's completely out"
"Bro, for me the biggest turn-off is that they removed the UDC and also dropped S Pen support. And yeah, I only mentioned the titanium frame because it would‚Äôve made the phone more durable and slightly lighter ‚Äî especially now that they‚Äôve made it slimmer, durability becomes even more important. So yeah, I was actually waiting for the Fold 7, but now I guess I‚Äôll just go for the Fold 6 instead üòÇ"
![gif](giphy|dtGIRL0FDp6nnOPGb5)
"I have a code for my birthday, plus a code for installing the application, then you can get a ‚Ç¨200 trade-in offer for a Galaxy device and it can be combined with the launch offer."
"Yes, a thinner and thinner phone that becomes less and less useful every year. Alternatively, they could make a phone for people who will actually use it for more than recording tik tok videos. This tiny battery and slow charging is ridiculous."
"Just make the body thicker, no workaround needed. Also solves at least three problems at once: Gigantic Camera Bumps, too small Batteries and the loss of the Headphone Jack.

I mean I have never met anyone say ""screw quality features, all I want is my next Phone to be thinner than my previous one"". This whole thin, thinner, thinnest circlejerk is nothing more than a manufacturer marketing competition without any value for the customer."
They could try the pop up kind of cameras. Remove the camera on the inside display and have a single pop up camera which you can turn 180¬∞.
"Oooooooh, so close."
I‚Äôm just playing playing devils advocate lol
"Added a 10MP camera to the inner display, so three"
"They should be the ultra cameras (wide and telephoto) especially since they have put the price up by an extra 200, the 200mp camera is fantastic but I miss the zoom of the ultra."
"You mean the inside screen?
Because the front one is Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2. I figure the anti-glare coating could have worked on it.

For the inside display, it is glass too, but has a plastic layer on top if I remember correctly. I figure they could at some point figure iut how to make it less reflective as well. Not all plastics are reflective."
"Unless they figure out some way to make glass fold, that's not going to change."
"Daddy, chill. I'm good with the inner screen feel."
How do you expect glass to fold exactly?
I hate how people are falling for this shitty marketing term that samsung uses for the inner screen. It's not glass. It's plastic. If you bend glass it breaks.
"Im with FOLD since the 2... Last week the screen of my Fold 6 break in half... ive became very sad with this product and Samsung, ive bought the S25 ultra and not going back to foldables."
"at this point I think I'm the one that knows nothing about the mobile phone market. I swear I see no one asking for thinner phones, especially when you have to have worse battery and cameras"
They probably already made their money back and now enjoying the lack of non Chinese competition to keep the price high
research and development of the new foldable tech
"Nah, No case on them feels great, i would do it too, but ive dropped mine before, and have a toddler."
"People always act like a phone without a case will almost surely get broken, but I've been using smartphones since the category came into existence and I've never broken a phone screen or otherwise seriously damaged one. I feel like phones are more robust than people give them credit for, and cases add less to it than people think - most of them don't really provide that much cushioning against things like drops anyway, and when I see people with damaged phones they're usually in cases. I suppose people are often worried about preserving trade-in value, although I've successfully traded in one of my non-cased phones for full value. If it's a personal choice to use a case to add your own style, sure, but it's not the sort of only responsible choice that people seem to portray it as."
Check out the Motorola Razr
The Fold 7 is actually more expensive despite lacking s-pen support and the under display camera. Who wouldn't want to pay for less?
I just don't care that it's removed. The only reason I'm not upgrading from 6 to 7 is mainly price and I really want the tri-food to replace my tablet.
"Never understood ppl that didn't get people who don't care about a feature and didn't use it, don't care it's removed üôÑ"
"BOE thinks Samsung violates their UDC patents, so Samsung isn't interested in using them for their new phones in case that they lose the lawsuit and the phones will have a sale stop"
"I think you underestimate the number of people who care about the S Pen.
It may be a minority on the grand scale of things as it has its niche but don't forget how much the Note series has impacted the market.

But you're right in thinking a lot of people don't know about the S Pen, however that's not the problem of the feature not being useful but rather a lack of marketing and awareness.

Just look at S Beam, completely abandoned by Samsung, now Apple has made their own version by making it work with AirDrop and successfully marketed it to be cool and people rave about it."
Im guessing they dont want to update the software for a fraction of an audience that barely uses the feature.
Why ask a rhetorical question?
"Samsung only have 20% market share in phones and 18% of that in high end ones. May as well scrap the whole company then since it's a minority, right? 

You feel snubbed because you're part of that tiny group, whilst everyone else couldn't care less and have probably already pre-ordered.
 
It's the same for the IR blaster or changeable storage. Not everyone used the first and the ""convenience"" of cloud storage + 512gb and higher options made the majority not care about which SD card has which media.  Options have been taken away before, just so happens this option is now something you're invested in."
"I know it's very unlikely, but I wish they introduced a ""Fold Ultra"" series. Where it's a bit thicker, but has Spen compatibility, along with the hidden camera, a few other things. (Bigger display, battery and such)"
I'll stick with my fold 4 until the hinge gives out and then go for the 6
"You're outnumbered. The vast majority does want a thicker brick phone, you are the reddit minority."
"I didn't say I want it to be less useful, one of the reasons amongst the 2,000 others why I won't be buying it. Chinese manufacturers are nailing the thin phone game while increasing battery life/capacity/charge speed. Was optimistic but I'll check out Samsung next year I guess."
"Normally, I'd agree with you  but it's a bit different for foldable because the thickness is doubled when it's closed so there is definitely a benefit to the thickness reduction on the Fold 7"
"I vote thicker phone with useful features also. This race to the thinnest device crap has got to stop. I don't care if it's as thick as two S24 Ultras taped together, just give me a phone that works. It doesn't matter how thin it is if it's useless."
"They made phones like that a long time ago, the mechanicals of it don't last and it takes a long time to open, it's adds cost and reliability issues. As well as being thicker as you now need gears etc in more then just the hinge. Also makes water resistance harder."
"I'll miss the zoom of the Ultra, but I also know there was no way they were gonna be able to cram in a periscope lense in there without a major redesign of the camera housing to be much bigger. Maybe they'll adopt a Google Pixel like camera bump, but that will also suck quite a bit to be honest."
me too. I'd rather trade the 2 never-used selfie cameras with a longer telephoto camera
Glass does not bend.
the s25 anti glare coating isnt glass. they should have at least applied it to the flex screen.
lol well.... obviously. but it's hard to justify when you're used to glass.
but for why?
I don't expect glass to fold I expect the screen to not feel like plastic.
No one's falling for that? We all know it's plastic. That's specifically why I won't endorse the device yet. It's just not pleasant. I want a glass screen. It just feels better.
Zac from jerryrigeverything did a durability test on the fold and it shattered. It is glass lol
That sounds traumatizing how did it happen lol
These companies don't know the market either. Like if they really knew the market they would make a version of the z flip with a full keyboard. There are people everywhere asking for tactile keyboard. People want the new retro.
"Yet, the Honor Magic V5 absolutely slams it in nearly every category for about $1250 üíÄ. I love Samsung's software but 1999 is *brutal* for a phone playing catch up with itself."
"Bro has clearly never seen my friend. 

He broke his phone, twisted it, somehow set it on fire, and even popped out the display. 

How. Idk. But I was there for the last 2. It genuinely happened out of nowhere. And they were both different phones from different brands."
Okay now that's an acceptable camera bump and I may have found my next phone. Appreciate it!
"‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt care so much they need to justify said feature going away to people that do care. Despite their user experience never changing. 


Yes make so much sense when you chime in that way /s"
"It‚Äôs a physical layer that is installed in the screen when it‚Äôs built. Not installing the layer allows the screen to be thinner and the body of the phone to be thinner. But remove that feature.

I read an article about this a few days ago"
Not really savings for us then is it
"They already removed many things I used - IR blaster, SD Card support etc. but the S Pen is a signature Samsung staple feature they have been invested in and offering for 13 years. It's not just an offering that other manufacturers offer too, it's a part of their mobile brand identity."
"I think the chunky boy phones are the ones that really sell (the pros and uktras of the like), just because they are more high end, regardless of thickness. Thin phones are niche products that don't sell that much."
"I had a OnePlus 7 Pro with the pop-up camera. It was hands down the best selfie camera configuration on any phone I've ever had. The pop-up mechanism worked flawlessly for 3 years, and not having a camera pointed at my face all the time was wonderful. Not to mention, no camera cutout. I would buy an S24U with a pop-up cam in a second. The S24U was the last decent phone Samsung made, and a pop-up would make me keep it for another 5 years."
The find N5 managed to fit a periscope and it has pen support (on both screens) as well while being the exact same thickness with a 5600mah battery! Lets face it Samsung's innovating. They're too big to try anymore just like apple.
But nobody asked for a slimmer phone. So they could have done it.
"Not normally, no.
But that's why they use the ultra-thin glass. When in such a thin layer, and given the right properties, it can and does bend.
That's exactly what the company manufacturing the glass screen components of most foldable smartphones has been doing for some years now:
https://www.schott.com/en-dk/expertise/applications/schott-utg-in-foldable-displays

And yeah, the first Galaxy Fold did use plastic. They started using this glass material from later Flip phones and onwards."
"Idk, maybe it's not very bendy either."
Because.... That's the best we have for now... We can't physically fold the glass of a slab phone in half just yet son.
Why not lol
Then don't buy the phone idiot.
"I got like -50 downvotes somewhere by saying its not glass its plastic. People responded by saying ""iTs GlAsS cAuSe SaMsUnG cAllS iT tHaT"" like i was actually surprised people thought its actual glass"
"Okay so... It's literally plastic on top of a tiny sheet of glass on each half. It's quite literally 100% plastic that you're touching. If you think it's foldable glass, that's wildly concerning."
"I'm sorry but Reddit doesn't know the market either. Every prediction is wrong because the companies have done more research.

It sucks, but the general populace is stupid"
"> $1250

In approximately 6 months, it'll reach that price bracket."
"Keep in mind with low camera bump comes low camera photos. I have a razr as a work phone and photos are passable but much lower quality than samsung. Video on the stock app straight up skips a second every 10-30 seconds losing whatever audio at that time and drops lots of frames. Using a third party app like gcam will make your photos better and won't skip full on seconds but will still drop frames in video. This applies to the base razr and plus, can't confirm if Ultra has the same issue"
"It's a feature used by the minority, removing it affects a small user base and they save cash. That's the justification. 

Not my fault you can't understand ü´†"
It's a thin ass layer
Did I say it was savings for us lol? Be realistic üòÇ
"Which is still there. Just not in this year's foldable..... because from reports, not enough people are using it to be a continued investment in the fold platform."
"It's literally one of the most common requests and the main complain from people when they see the Fold: it was too thick when folded.

Here's a US survey from 2024 about the things people were mostly concerned when considering a foldable smartphone: https://imgur.com/a/GcZy9tj

I get it that many people didn't care about the thickness. After all, Samsung has been selling Folds for several generations now. But they also want to break further into the mainstream market. And that comes by making the phones thinner before the competition manages to do that at a global scale."
There's less glass than there is plastic and the part that actually matters is all plastic.
Seriously? Do you want a physics explanation of why its not possible to bend glass?
That's honestly stunning üòÇ  the gullibility of the masses. They probably think the battery is bigger because the screen is
Following up on this honestly I've been getting downvoted anywhere I've said anything about it being plastic. These plastic screen cultists are worse than Apple users

That's why marketing is very powerful
There is indeed plastic protecting the thin glass.
"Maybe the companies are using AI to predict what the market wants but the market is just AI telling the company random stuff they put more emphasis into the Galaxy AI features that nobody really wants then actually announcing the new phones. All they had to do was release a fold call it the fold Ultra put an S pen in it and give it a triple fold and the world would have gone wild. But instead we got the same exact thing as last year with a slightly larger screen and slightly thinner, and incredibly overpriced watches. And some ai features that aren't substantially better than the current existing feature-- which by the time you FINALLY get it to listen to you, it would have been faster to just do it yourself."
"They save cash.  Thanks this was the part I was hoping you would say.  Consumers pining for increasing shareholder value. In a company they hold no shares in I‚Äôm sure. 


I do get it, that‚Äôs why I got you to admit you‚Äôre a fanboy.


Thanks for playing along bud."
"Pls daddy Samsung save more money, you're suffering"
When they remove a feature you use I hope you remember what you said here
I‚Äôm not an engineer. I‚Äôve no idea what thickness it was. Most stuff is in mm or smaller. Maybe just corporate bs for corner cutting.
"Why are you deep throating Samsung then?

Praising them for removing features and increasing the price"
"Not there in the foldable, I know it may seem overreactive, but going by this logic they may eventually kill it on the Ultra too. They already came for the Bluetooth support."
"Yup, that is absolutely true. They have plenty of layers on top of layers. But it's neat to see them still trying to push for the ideal full glass only scenario."
Why the fuck are you responding to me
You touch plastic. You don't touch glass. Therefore. It's plastic.
"100%

It's just more cost saving stuff while they bump up the price to sell you less"
"I never praised anything tho? Your reading comprehension is hilarious. 

Stay in your feelings, it's amusing."
"I would agree with that logic based on the reduced functions of it, but they didn't outright get rid of it due to the ultra being it's flagship (don't wanna cripple the golden child). 

Imo I see them going the way of apple ipads and having the pen as a stand alone item that costs a chunk of cash instead of being integrated in the phone. Since I don't see apple releasing their version of a pen with their foldable if it isn't sold separately for half the price of the phone. 

The way i see it ending up is some form of Samsung's perfected pen + apples perfected iPad + whoever manages to perfect a foldable = some sort of device that satisfies phone users and tablet ppl in one ""perfect"" package. They are just currently in the process of parceling each component out like a AAA game dlc so they can charge for each individual component."
[removed]
That's what you mean lol. Well yeah of course in that case you touch plastic. If I put a plastic screen protector on top of my s25 screens I will be touching plastic instead of glass. The ultra thin glass does have glass though.
"That's the point I don't want to be touching plastic not to mention it's way easier to permanently damage a plastic screen than it is a glass screen. There are no solid screen protectors for the fold, sidebar completely unrealistic that we have to use screen protectors and can't just use our phones, but regardless I don't have to live in fear of breaking my plastic screen"
"You can remove that plastic and still have glass

What happens if you remove the plastic on the fold"
"I'm very sure that they said (or at least implied, mocked other vendors and/or used in ads) that they wouldn't remove the phone jack, or the micro sd support, or the charger in the box.

I can like their phones, but I don't believe anything they say. If people use enough of the AI stuff, they will charge for it for sure."
They probably don't want to be the first to announce the fees for AI so maybe if Apple charges for it then they will follow but Apple's stupid intelligence is still not usable.
Let's take that with a grain of salt.
"From the Fold 7 pre-order page: 

""Galaxy AI features by Samsung are free through 2025 and require Samsung account login.""

I bet they put it behind a pay wall next year."
"Yes and they had no plan to remove the jack, the charger in the box and so on"
I'm not using any of it anyway so I don't care if they did.
I worked at Samsung when the term Galaxy AI was first used. Back then they wanted to charge for it after a year or something so I wouldn't trust this at all.
... Yet
Most people don‚Äôt plan to go to jail either. Circumstances change
"Not surprised in the slightest, they're not stupid enough to charge for these gimmicks at least not the first ones.

If someone like apple starts doing it and they see it' profitble then they'll do it."
"I dont see AI being charged for in the near future. I can see new OS update features on the flagship phone being a subscription for older devices. These features may be used with AI but not vital for phone to work. There are no drastic changes in hardware every year, I jump every 4 years or so. Would I pay monthly for a feature instead of buying a new phone? Probably not, but some will."
"They will when enough people start using those tools, and people start to depend on them. They will remove the tools people dont need, or rarely use. Not like they can actually run those for free. AI is expensive regardless."
"If apple does, they will too"
"That's what every business say, then 6 months later... ""To aid development of XYZ, we're implementing a tiered program starting at ONLY $c.cc per month.:This will include shit you already have, shit we think you want, and shit you'll never use."""
"It states they have no plans at the moment, however they might have those plans tomorrow."
Because no one is using that wish they would come without Ai¬†
wish they would so i could avoid AI as much as possible
The usage level of the Ai features is so low that charging for those will kill them
But can you remove them for free?
"I couldn't possibly care any less about Samsung's Ai tools they are a waste of space imo¬†


Having a fold 6 I've barely touched them and when I have I've always been largely disappointing¬†"
"Because all the processing is done on device itself, only the database needed for AI to operate is on server."
"Sure they won't, think of all the nice juicy metadata they are getting in return. Until they exploit that fully, and then they will charge, and will make it so you are unable to disable it."
"Oh, they do.....they just don't want to be first to do so.  They want someone else to fall on that sword."
"Yet my friend,yet. They can always change their mind like give you one year free after announcement"
This means they will but only latter after they mocked everyone who charge for it
"During the Galaxy Unpacked July 2025 Live event, Rick Osterloh (SVP, Google Platform & Devices) said, ""So the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Flip7 will both come with 6 months of Google AI Pro on us."" (https://www.youtube.com/live/0cMS8qECR0A?si=UHGH64OyMm7q4CvE&t=5001)

Subscription-based products as per usual.

I'm assuming this is just one loophole to get away with stating, ""Samsung says it has no plans to charge a fee for its Galaxy AI tools""."
I'd hope so seeing as how I never use it and can get annoying when I accidentally trigger it
Because they realize that no one would pay
"I hope they do charge, because I need a reason for them to not make me use their ai service they shoved in my face"
"Well that's good because I have no plans to ever pay for Galaxy AI ""tools""."
of course because they are going to sell your information for a profit and make it required to use their AI tools so you cannot opt out so they win either way!
"yeah but galaxy fold 7 price just gone up compared to fold 6. Also, trade in values are not as good as previous years........."

No reason because it's utter shit that people aren't going to pay for anyway.
What is even worth charging for?
"When the S24 came out they said it would be free for a year and then they'd charge. My S23+ got the AI update that said the same.


Haven't used the AI tools cause they don't do anything I couldn't do elsewhere. Why get used to something only to be annoyed when they take it away.¬†"
I don't like so called A.I. so it means piss all to me if they pay wall their A.I. features. What I would be pissed off about is if they start shoving ads for paid A.I. tools in my face in default apps
"Until Apple decides it wants money for their version, then it's fair game"
"""No plans"" just means they haven't agreed internally _how_ much to charge and when to start."
Let's see if they will keep their words. And how long.
"Yet they've made a disclaimer that it's free ""during certain year"" since the S24"
Yes they will.
Duh. The user data is worth a lot more than 20$ a month
I'd actually pay them a small fee to have the ability to remove and disable all AI from my phone forever. There's not one single feature I've seen or heard about that I would ever use or that I'm even remotely interested in.
It's funny how Samsung is on their own since Apple has no AI. LOL
"It's good to know and another reason for me to get back to samsung, i had a s8 and a s10 they both where lagging so much i moved to pixel 6 pro never got a problem and i have a pixel 8 pro.

And i had to wait a year and a half to get the feature promised. And the pixel 8a have the health battery while the 8 and 8 pro can't.

Am i doing a bad choice ? Is the Ui of samsung still lagging after 2 years of normal use?"
They mocked other companies for those things tho never promised they wouldn‚Äôt follow suit.
Or removable battery
"I mean Apple Ai (has trash as it is) hasn‚Äôt been charging people yet so I think Samsung would wait for apple to test the waters on that.

Might be like a free tier & paid tier thing in the future."
"they will charge, but it will be hidden. instead of seeing your regular price increment every year for the Sxx phone, you will see a much larger increase, masked by ""cutting edge ai"". tbh they did that for S23 and S24 atleast in my region"
I really miss the headphone jack port.
"They will likely charge at some point, but it's so bad very few people will pay for it."
"Or until the profit margin turns out to be lower than expected. And then it'll be ""Jeeze, look at all the AI processing power charges, time to switch the plan and add limit free AI to 1st year of device again"""
"True, this isn't legally binding or anything."
Why? They're not worth charging for.
"gr-AI-n... has AI in it, unfortunately we're going to have to charge you extra for that."
"I was browsing the shop Samsung app last night and the first time print asterisk says ""Samsung AI tools will remain free until the end of 2025"".

So I'm definitely taking it with a grain of salt."
That‚Äôs been there since the S24. I feel like it‚Äôs there for legal purposes.  None of the AI stuff is worth it for me anyways to pay for it and the only one I use is circle to search which is a Google thing not a Samsung thing. If they don‚Äôt let me use it I‚Äôll use on my Pixel phone or Apple version on my iPhone.
"> Galaxy AI is supported for the current flagship devices. Previous Galaxy devices require additional support and optimization, so we have decided to give owners of older devices the opportunity to access the same great features with a small monthly payment.

Source: I made this up, but it's believable."
They never promised they wouldn't remove the jack or charger in the box. Their marketing team just made (what's now in hindsight) shortsighted jabs at Apple for doing that.
"Im in the same boat as you, but with the amount of time they spend marketing the AI features as basically part of the hardware every release (like seriously they spend more time talking about the ai than the actual hardware), it would be criminal to then charge for them after buying a 2k+ device."
they are the first ones google already charges for top tier gemini it only comes with the largest price google one sub
They won‚Äôt ever charge for it tbh because as the same as Google and google search we are the product. Our data that they collect is the price of admission.
100% true and sad
"That's true for many Galaxy AI features but not all of them. Also some AI features are less robust when they're forced to run on-device, but the trade-off is they're more private."
they arent the first google already charges for top tier access to gemini
Is this true???
They release the sneaky golem when you least expect it.
"I get the difference, but I don't see it as some kind of court of law where I'd analyze the semantics and whether or not they used specific words or phrases. If a company is mocking or using something as a selling point and then turns back on it, I know not to believe what they said. 

But I get it if you see it differently."
"That's what you think, but not what they think."
They are but I wouldn't pay. I already paid for the phone.

"Oh was it only the ads ? Okay.

Still shitty from them but whatever."
"When a company mocks another company for doing something shitty, you would think they are trying to convey to the customer that they won't go down that same *shitty* road.

They did fast, too. It wasn't like they waited a few generations, they literally killed all of this stuff like 1-2 generations later after mocking Apple."
All the AI features Sammy has on their phones in Galaxy AI Google also has free on Pixels.
"Also, do we get the free storage upgrade because the 1TB is only available with the cheaper to produce colors?"
"I don't know about when the 256=516GB offer ends, but it's true that it's usually limited. This kind of offer usually ends when the pre-order period ends."

Clash royale joke in samsung subreddit.I've seen it all
They were used as marketing selling points. I never took it as the promising to never remove it. Remember the Galaxy S6 removed the SD card before adding it back in the S7.
"I think they would get a rude awakening if they tried people are largely conditioned for free Ai via chat gpt, Gemini,¬† claude¬†


Yes they offer paid tiers but most users don't opt for that outside of businesses¬†"
yes but they still charge for gemini pro which is better than gemini baseline only comes with the 1tb google one plan
"That's what I originally thought, then this guy is saying ""today only"" which had me confused."
"I know, and as I said, I get your point, it's cool. Just let me put it this way:

Say you know a dude, and every time you eat Italian pasta he makes fun of you saying it's crap and stupid. Then a while later he's eating Italian pasta every chance he got. 

Then he mocks you for using blue shirts every time you use then. Months later, he appears using blue shirts all the time. 

Then he codes an app, gives you access and says it won't ever charge you for it. Would you take him for his word? Cause I won't, lol.

But again, I see your point. It's quite clear."
"Damn stop licking the boot lmao, so cringe seeing people defending billionaire corporation"
"The point is not clear, he's just defending the shit anti consumer practices Samsung did"
Boot licking for stating facts ? I never said I agreed with it. Critically think first perhaps ?
"Correction: It's not the Watch8 Ultra, it's the Watch Ultra (2025)."
"It's not the galaxy watch 8 ultra, it's just the 2025 refresh of the galaxy watch ultra. Same thing just adds the vascular monitoring thing"
pretty sure I have that on my wrist rn.
I'll just order the blue band and boom watch ultra 2025
"Feelings about Samsung the last couple years

![gif](giphy|jrhtSSLRtPagnk5Nxu)"
This year watches are mostly for people who haven't upgraded yet. There is no need to buy these over 2024 models.
aaaand now everyones going to be calling the watch**8** ultra :/
Only difference with this Ultra is more storage and the blue color. Everything else is the same as the last Ultra.
There really is no innovation lol just milking AI
"I really hope this comparison on their page is wrong. They nerfed the crap out of this thing if not.

Same CPU/RAM, smaller battery, aluminum over titanium material, ditched the action button, smaller display.



Edit: If you look at the plain specs of the new Ultra, it says it has the same 590 mAh, but the compare shows 300. Sadly, the rest of the specs line up with the compare. This is hard pass for me."
Nice but not worth trading in for the watch 7 ultra.
"How Samsung sees the consumers after mentioning that the PoopenSharten-Watch will have Shit and farting tracking capabilities instead of a better battery life and GPS tracking knowing damn well someone is going to buy it.

https://preview.redd.it/bdsy4tl4xvbf1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c293d1fac09e7b82150a0a979be0abf93159ea5"
Anyone have Watch 7 Ultra vs 8 Ultra differences .. worth it at all ?
No RAM upgrade is insane. These watches can't run Samsung's bloated UI on 2 GB alone.
I think ima just go back to a garmin fenix
"Damn the other one was selling at a huge discount with EPP/student and trade in deals a few days ago when I decided to wait for this ""new"" one to launch. Now the price is the max price again :-|"
"There used to be huge discount on watch 7 ultra on shop Samsung app for like $250, seems like it's gone now?"
Ugly as hell
They want to be Apple so bad.
"After checking it on the website it just feels like a squircle galaxy watch 6 classic with that shortcut button added on the side. If I traded my 6 classic in for it I would be paying what I paid to get it the first time:  450-95 = 355.

And compared to my watch 6 classic what I hate the most is that the black colour way is more like a silver with black accents compared to watch 6 classic which is coloured black all around.

Whats new
![gif](giphy|fm0FiSOfefH5m)
"I skipped the first edition Ultra, assuming that they'd improve and iterate on it for the next gen. Seems they haven't really done that, but I'll still likely get this as I love the design. I haven't brought a new one since the 5 I think. I have a 4 Classic and 5 regular. I guess I'll trade one of them in."
yea I will just keep my Galaxy watch Ultra from Ultra this is hilarious yet another year of NOPE to upgrades...
"100 hours in power saving mode, how much in normal? 24 probably"
Im on a Galaxy Watch4 so feel like this would be a big jump for me lol
And one to two days of battery life as usual?
Ugly
"Not a fan of the squared circle design. It takes the worst from both a square and circle design and mashes them together. Square screens are just better. They are more functional. If you want to argue that a circle screen looks better, sure fine. I don't think so on a smart watch but if you do fine. But this gives the ""ugliness"" of a square watch with the objectively worse screen shape."
"Im still rocking my watch 5 pro...
Still see 2-3days of battery life. Can get more if I needed."
The trade options here are so bad man. Taking last year watch 7 for next watch 8 at literally half the price.
Looks fire
"If I'm buying a watch this year, which model do y'all recommend for someone new to Galaxy watches who's primarily interested in their health tracking purposes? Thinking maybe the classic 8 or the other new 8 that's available this yr, but it's just unclear what the differences are between the two."
They just added new colour and called it a day
new and (maybe) improved
"When Is One UI 8 for the Watch UI coming?
I've got a galaxy watch 7."
So just a new blue colour
"Samsung : put the now bar on everything. 
Also Samsung: i said put the now bar on everything not make it work on everything..."
You know this design started to grow on me actually. I like it.
"If I wanted a square watch I would just get an Apple Watch. I'll be sticking with my ancient Galaxy Watch Classic 4 for the foreseeable future, new features be damned."
Are there any changes from the 2024 version? You can't even trade in the 2024 for the 2025.
i dont understand why they dont just commit to a circle or a rectangle. hopefully a rectangle
Still ugly af
Thanks for those unreadable photos
doesn't look that bad
Why is it so hard to put a blood sugar monitor in the watch?? Come on!
samapplesung with their ‚Äúnew‚Äù ultra LOL !
"I know I'm probably out of line, but they really need to make the screen squarish for me to be interested to get one."
Will it work on iOS? Or are companies still be lame
"You are correct, my mistake."
"Hello Apple ? Seems Samsung is following in thier steps with this. Same watch, just a storage increase and new color. Woo hoo!"
[deleted]
Samsung thinks we're a bunch of suckers.
You can't even trade in the current ultra lmao.
From where? The bands arent compatible with last years ultra
"Same. I would have actually considered going back to a Samsung phone with the fold 7. Everything I have is Samsung. I'm fully in the ecosystem minus the phone now. I switched to the honor magic v3 last year. I would have switched back to the z fold 7 but the battery and charging are straight out of 2018. 25w has absolutely ZERO business being called ""super fast charging"" in 2025. The z fold 7 is advertised as getting from 0-50% in 30 minutes. Shit in 30 minutes my phone is literally 77% charged and it has a 5100mah battery. If I need power quickly, like actually need ""super fast charging"" Samsung just isn't it. My phone does 0-50% in 17.5 minutes. That's actually pretty fast but it's not even the fastest charging foldable."
"True,¬† have the old galaxy watch 5, will be upgrading but only because my 5 is crap now"
"Thats why they're not marketing this as a new watch, just a refresh"
The official website lists it as a 590mAh watch with Titanium and that applies to the compare chart too
"At the moment, trading in the 2024 Ultra isn't even an option. 
(though a Samsung sales chat agent says it will be soon)"
Double the storage and some new colors. That is all the difference between the two watches.
I love my Fenix 8.  I'm here to stay.  Samsung watches have nothing on the Fenix 8.
It's discounted at Best Buy
They should just make a rectangle watch already
"They are paying me 450 for my Watch 7 Ultra. However, they don't let you compare it so I don't really know the differences, so I will pass."
"There is a new color, and double the storage. Other than that, I don't see any changes. 
And yeah, the original Ultra isn't listed as a trade-in option. I guess they figure no one is going to bother doing that."
My vote is dodecahedron.
They are very readable? If you cant read them its your eyes not the picture lol
![gif](giphy|BY8ORoRpnJDXeBNwxg)
Non-invasive gm would need large amounts of training data to be accurate. And it will even differ by people's skin tones and so. It is ofc be released in the future with AI advancement.
Then the blood monitoring companies wouldn't make any money.
Nope
It's a refresh...they never marketed it as anything different than a refresh of the existing ultra. The Galaxy watch 8 classic is the new watch. Relax.
"They have been following Apple's footsteps for years now. It's the reason I'm about to jump ship to Apple. Why buy a copy of Apple when I can just by Apple. I've purchased Samsung products for the last 10 years because they used to set the trends, not follow them. This watch isn't any different."
[deleted]
then that says a lot...
Wait wha?....
I saw that too i was thinking what the hell. Same watch though i guess.
You can now trade in the previous Ultra. 250.00 discount.
Exactly! Its retarded
You can and I did. 3 hundred down the drain.
"Can confirm, I currently have the Samsung Blue Marine band on my Ultra from last year
*"
"Well, crap baskets lol"
Why tf would they design a latch mechanism to only use it for 1 yearü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I agree. I don't care so much for the folding phone but same situation. Everything I have is Samsung except my phone, I've been looking for a reason to possibly switch back but they definitely haven't given one"
"Yeah, looks like they updated it. Still, same watch with double storage? I am still good with my current Ultra."
"Thank you 
Wow samsung becoming so lame like Apple with recycled hardware 
I shall skip üòå"
"Yea, I seen the new ones have more smart capabilities now, like phone calls. I have a tactix of the 6 variant. I just cant justify spending 1k on a new one right now"
I want a refresh of the Samsung gear S. Except no button. Just all screen that wraps around the wrist.
Samsung USA? It's not an option for me.
Are you really running out of space on a watch?
I read that 2 new health features will be available on ui8.  Do you think that's true?
Yes! I vote yes!
"Lol you can read what is written on the left of the picture ? Because I can't even while zooming in, maybe reddit compression idk about his original picture but it's unreadable

Not my eyes, but rather you that is a lier xD"
Good.
Strike a nerve did we ?
"If they followed Apple, they would make phones that break easy and were designed for people with learning disabilities to navigate easily."
"Technology is not bought for trends, but for the capabilities of software and hardware. I could never replace Android with iOS because Android is superior in every way and offers far more freedom. Of course, I also get annoyed with Samsung for copying Apple, I even find myself starting to despise them for it. However, I would rather switch to another Android manufacturer than to that stupid iOS."
In this case it is often Apple which copies the functionalities of Android
"Lol following Apple üòÇ Can you please point us in the direction of the Apple fold, Apple flip? Been waiting on Apple to do something new for a decade and nothing. What do you expect them to do with these watches? There‚Äôs not much to change that would be mind blowing right now."
[deleted]
Cause it‚Äôs the same one they just added one thing they never said it was new they don‚Äôt want you to upgrade.
"Tbf why would you wanna trade in your watch to get literally the exact same watch. And I don't mean that like ""Oh they released a new watch but didnt change anything,"" no, its literally the same watch. Samsung never said this was new and they aren't marketing it as new, just a refresh of last year's"
"They added that today. Yesterday the latest watch you could trade in was the 7.


Also 250 trade in is terrible value. You could have made 300 by selling it on FB."
so is the band connector the same? or different?
Bc they have become greedy to the extreme
"I'm honestly surprised that they 'refreshed' it.

Usually there shouldn't have been any announcement for the Ultra, just like there was no Classic when the 5 Pro dropped. They probably thought publicly 'refreshing' it would help sales for that model to show that it's not a last years model but still the current Pro/Ultra version that's part of a different lineup to the Classic lineup

Funny enoigh, I can get the Ultra 2024 for 350‚Ç¨ new üòÇ"
It's just a refresh of the pre-existing Watch Ultra. They aren't even trying to market it as a new product.
Same I forgot about that watch but now I definitely want it back
"No, not at all. I currently have 20Gb free. (of 32). But I don't store anything on mine. I could maybe see an advantage for people who store music/podcasts/etc on it for use off grid. I'm rarely offline or without my phone though, so that's never been something I needed."
"everything I've read says those features are part of UI8 itself, not specifically tied to the new hardware. Most sites say all of these new ""features"" will be available on the 2024 Ultra with UI8. 

So a month or two from now, the only difference will be the new color and the 64gb vs 32gb storage."

*

I can't put my finger on it. Was it the Ultra name that Samsung decided to use, same as Apple? Is it the orange band? The naming of the band, Ocean vs marine? The square design? 

What about their earbuds? Why did Samsung go from their tried and true bean design to the Apple airpod shaped design? 

I don't even own any Apple products. I have purchased the top Samsung phone every year for the past 10 years. Even I can see the blatant copying is apparent."

Confirmed on my 2024 Watch Ultra running One UI 8 beta I can access the new health features.
"This makes things more clear now...> ) i have the old/outdated model and will need to wait 2 months to get it ""Updated"" WoW"

So colored bands and hardware names are the same as actual different hardware? Where‚Äôs the Apple fold? Apple flip? Apple ring? I bet Samsung drops their AR glasses first before Apple too. Apple focusing on the wrong things like the massive flop Apple Vision. No need to innovate when their piggy banks buy up every new iPhone every year. I‚Äôve been on iPhone for over a decade waiting on something new and it‚Äôs the same phone every year with shinier cameras. I‚Äôm switching to android with the fold 7. Done waiting.
"You really need to look up facts about apple. Samsung has always mad the majority of parts for apple phones and samsung has always lead the way in tech and advancement of tech. Point to the apple watch with a round screen, youre talking things like bands and names and colors. Fyi this Ultra watch actually came out in like 2023/2024 they just did a refresh for some reason. 
The galaxy watch 8 classic brought back the rotating bezel so point to the apple watch that has that as well. 
I dont care which one you like overall samsung or apple but know what youre talking about."
alright good. the only difference is the watch8 and 8 classic
if you're holding a press conference already why the fuck would you not announce it there tho
"Same, Watch Ultra on One UI beta runs Vascular Load and Antioxident Index just fine."
They really made the best phone they‚Äôve done in years and put the worst processor possible. üò≠
1200 for exynos in a flip phone. Never ever hahaha
Damn the trade in values are pretty terrible
Thank you Samsung for saving me money. Why is there no Silver option?
Exynos ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Overall not bad, but the Exynos processor, bruh."
My wallet is aching just looking at that üò≠
"Dread it, run from it. Exyshit still arrives"
Cameras are pretty bad on this devices
Gonna wait for a better deal aint no way ima trade in my flip 5 lol at least add a box charger. Smh none of these include em for the price we pay. üò≠
I was actually really liking this till I saw the processor üíÄ.
"man, I'm so annoyed that they brought the premium camera to the fold but not the lip T-T"
"Here comes the ""empty box"" trade ins"
Does anyone know when those preorder deal emails will be going out? I want the mint color but don‚Äôt have the money without the deal lmao üíî
"Why the exynos chip smh
Might just have to go to w the flip 6 lol"
"the Flip 7 cameras are gonna be sick,, Same 50MP setup but with way better processing and that new ProVisual Engine? Plus taking selfies with that huge cover screen is gonna be insane man

I'm ready this is gonna be my main camera phone!"
looks like the new motorolla razr tbh
"And they are using Exynos which has always underperformed in the past.  Nope, don‚Äôt want one now"
Can I run any app I want on the cover screen now?¬†
"Thin is cool, but my flip 6 over heats after 5m of Android auto wireless so I dread to think what this will be like"
Not worth it
"Funny they mentioned and showed the Fold as having SD Elite but nothing was mentioned or shown in the summary about the Flip's processor. 

Also, I thought that we were not meant to put anything like credit cards etc in between the screen.  Yet however, I swear that during the skateboarding segment, a person put the Flip 7 on the edge of a fixture with the inner screen and 'crease' making contact with it.  Is it now that much stronger (if I'm not wrong with what I saw - I haven't watched it again)? 

Anyway, watching the Unpacked one phrase came to mind ""JerryRig""."
the exynoss chipset is concerning but if its good I think this will be my next phone
would love a flip phone with a snapdragon and real glass. that plastic will get scratched by my clumsy hands with ease.
Exynos for that price!
"DO NOT BUY!!! The flips are piece of shits. I have two different models that both ""broke"". Samsung refused to replace them even though less than a year old. Never dropped one of them but yet they said there was physical damage. One of the flips won't even open, yes that one I dropped one time and then it wouldn't open back up after that. The other the screen was working then stopped all of a sudden. So I'm now out $2000 and have 2 flip phones that don't work and having to use a different brand phone!!! DO NOT BUY THE FLIP!!!!!!"
"i switched to the razr you know you want to. you've been fed a pack of lies about the ""premium-ness"". it's probably just as fragile (no moreso) but it feels nice AF in every single other way and you can use gboard on the front."
The design is pretty cool. I love it! I tested it at the flagship store. I must say it has earned a spot on my wishlist.
"When will they stop putting exynos in their flagship phones? This is absolutely atrocious, I would absolutely NEVER buy them"
Why do so many people moan about the processor? It's really not that big of a deal in 2025
üôåüèª
so your better off with one of the previous generation flips.....GOT IT what another useless year for Samsung fans I am done with them at this point they are no different than Apple.
"Just a few more years of unimpressive foldable sales and we will be done with this gimmick and can get back to adding old innovations that they took away from their phones, and adding some new ones."
T-Mobile US showing on specifications the Snapdragon Elite.
the outer screen is really cool tho
Yea gone are the days of $100 upgrades.
I couldn't believe the low values last year even though the 6 wasn't much of an upgrade over the 5. But I'm not doing it again. Certainly not with the trade-in credits only dropping $100 for each previous generation. I'll hang onto my 6 and hope the ZFlip 8 introduces something worth paying for.
"Trade values and trade options... I got an unlocked moto razr 2025 and I have no option to appraise it.

interesting stance to take for a company that wants to sell more units and increase their foldables footprint"
Only up to $600 in the US?!  LoL.  Samsung must think that they are selling iPhones.
Would be kind of nice if this would pave the way to LineageOS or other custom roms being available. Seems like only Exynos device in the past had this available.
Showing Snapdragon elite on specifications @ T-Mobile
Showing Snapdragon elite on specifications @ T-Mobile
I would get a Razr. The highest end model doesn't have Samsung's bargain bin chip in it and the non-ultras have a cheaper price tag lol.
Are you saying that we should get an email that has different deals than the website deals?
The exynos is actually scoring significantly higher than the Flip 6's 8 Gen 3 in benchmarks.
No. You still have to install Good Lock to do anything useful with the front screen.
"Lol I thought it was just me. After 5 mins, google map goes ""disabling 3d buildings cuz your phones too hot"""
Which flip versions did you have though.
True
"I was all ready to swap my S24U to a Flip 7, but not for $600!"
The issue with that is the cover screen as (afaik) lineages has no support for cover displays
"The flip is running an Exynos 2500 chip, only the fold is getting the Snapdragon SoC."
I trust Samsung more than T-Mobile with Samsung specs
"But the moto has worse build quality, worse software support, thicker bezels and so on"
"I wanted the ultra, but spectrum Mobile doesn't offer it, they are giving $925 ($225 +700 bonus) for my flip 6 though towards the 7, so I'm going for that."
"If you put your email in before the debut they offered like, $1000 off with a trade in but preorders are happening now so idk"
Need to wait for Geekerwan's efficiency test.
who cares about useless benchmarks.
"No one cares about benchmarks, Exynos always had worse efficiency resulting in overheating and the modem sucks"
"Do you know how the watches work with apps? I'm coding my own Paramedic App to use at work. It's only HTML/JS/CSS, and it just uses a web browser to function."
Yeah I've tried leaving it open and closed but same issue. It's better then plugged in but more hassle of course
"The first one I had was the 4, that one I dropped one time in a case and it wouldn't open back up. The second one that the screen just stopped responding after 6 months was the 6.¬†"
In Italy with student discounts I can trade in my S24U to a Flip 7 for 195‚Ç¨
"I'm curious what my carrier offer will look like. My S24u is paid off, so I can either take a good upgrade option if offered or keep the S24u and move to a reseller like Mint."
You'll probably put a case on it anyway and their 1200 dollar phone doesn't have Exynos in it üò≠
"Ooh, that's a solid price. I'm on T-mobile and my plan refreshes tomorrow but I'm honestly really fancying the Edge. It's completely free with a trade (I have a S23 base) and I look forward to all of the extra real estate that's lighter than my current phone at 0 dollars a month.

An Ultra would cost over 400 and the new Fold is 900 so I'm not totally impressed by them lol."
"I did that, but never got an email..."
People do care about benchmarks.  Just because you don't does not mean others don't. We don't buy one new computer or phone or even our new 2025 Mach E GT without knowing the performance first!
Directly with Samsung?¬†
I've just looked at T-Mobile and they'll cover the entire phone in return for 24 months of commitment. I have to admit it's tempting!
Mine is offering it free with my S24U trade in. I am inclined to go with that offer. I love the zoom camera but carrying this slab in the pocket and holding it for extended time periods is a pain.
"Yeah, that makes sense, id probably do the same in your case."
My wife and I are getting Flip 7 for trading our old Flip 5 on tmobile...on 24 month commitment that is. It's the 512 mb storage model. My Flip 5 has a cracked screen but the tmobile app said that is ok. I still get the phone free:)
yeah me neither that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm asking if it‚Äôs typical for them to take a while or nah
Caring too much about benchmarks are stupid because they aren't reflective of real world performance. Graphics driver support and power efficiency mean a lot more than just some raw numbers.
Yes
"My wife and I both ordered Flip 7's and will mail our Flip 5's to Samsung. Net cost zero over 24 months like you mentioned. Blue for me, Coral Red for her. Can't wait!"
"You're better off buying a used S10e or S11 and selling your S24U for a profit or keeping it as a backup phone.  You can easily find a S10 or S10e for $100 or less in many places.  Also make sure you're on the right plan because right now it's Go5G Plus or higher.

"I got a text while I was asleep

Sh't, i only slept 3 hours after being up for 21 hours. I need to get one of those watches finally. I'm not sure which one i want yet, but i don't pay enough attention to how I treat myself."
Great deal. That‚Äôs what I was hoping for price wise. No way I‚Äôm paying $600!
Did you purchase directly from Samsung but choose the T-Mobile option?
"I use xfinity. I also have a Galaxy S20 5G. Their offer is:

Trade in: || Offer

Nothing || Pay $25/mo for 24 months, as in total cost of Flip = $600 spread over 2 years.

S20 5G (I have one), of S10e (if I buy) || Get $600 off of the $1100 price and pay $500 over two years. That means the phone only is worth $100. 

iPhone 13 256GB || $750 off and you pay $14.58 for 24 mo.

I do not buy into expensive carrier plans that offer more trade in value because I would end up paying that much for services I don't use. I have a basic 4-line + 1 watch plan where each line costs about $25 for unlimited."
I still haven‚Äôt gotten my text or email
"They just released a new code for the foldables. This is insane

https://preview.redd.it/j6cwmyubqxbf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36791a5d487f1097b0aa0f9578e7ece379ddc39b"
u/MysticYogi0104 I guess it all depends on usage.  For us it's actually cheaper to stick with T-Mobile because we're paying $200 for 6 lines (2 free lines) and a free watch line.  My wife and I get a new upgrade every year and our kids get a free 1 year old hand me down.  I also use the other 2 free lines as hotspots and upgrade whenever my parents need a new phone or when their device is close to end of life and I can still get maximum value trade in hence why I mentioned that the previous person shouldn't trade in their device that has value in it when they can just find a cheap trade in.
"Maybe talk to one of those swindling customer help people.

Shit is expensive either way. I spent almost 2K for the 1TB phone and watch classic. That's with my first responder discount and 800 trade in for the fold6 and  the 50 dollar reservation promo"
Damn that‚Äôs a fantastic deal. Jetblack is a nice choice!
"I like the T Mobile $200 plan. If I were to switch carriers, that probably would be it. I am currently paying about 120 for 4 lines + 1 watch. We don't need to upgrade every year so we rather save monthly. 

I am also looking to change over from Apple Watch 6 to new Galaxy Watch 8. Or maybe keep two watch lines."
"I have a student discount, but I‚Äôm still confused on why I haven‚Äôt gotten a text or email about that $1000 off promo for a trade in. If I can‚Äôt get that, 30% off is still a relatively okay deal, especially if this is only really going to get the most use this year since I‚Äôm graduating and getting an office job immediately after"
"Yeah it is! I tried the new Flip 7 today and it really looks great, even though I had in the past an old Z Flip 3 and the build quality didn't really convince me, the device still works, but the ""bezels"" around the screen came off, so I don't think I'm still ready for a foldable, considering that was a second phone too..."
Is it even worth it? The only difference I could find compare to the GW7 is a slightly bigger battery that probably will allow like 1h extra...
"Please ditch that ""squircle"" design. It is so ugly. Round display -> round watch."
I was expecting non-squary design but it looks like I'm sticking with my GW5Pro another year..
If the battery doesn't last at least 7 days there's no improvement
"Why the F are they making it square but still having a circular screen? It looks ugly, it feels cheap, it is just so wrong and dumb. What are they thinking? Dont they have good designers?

If this is the design going forward, I guess I'll never upgrade from the Watch 7."
I was wondering if upgrading from watch 7 to watch 8 for $80 worth it? If I don't when watch 9 comes out trading value will not be the same. Thankyou.
"While I'm glad the rotating bezel returned for the Watch8 Classic, 46mm is too big of a watch for me.  All my analog watches are in the 41-43mm range.  I don't want a watch that looks oversized.  I guess I'm sticking with my Watch6 Classic."
Worth upgrading from the watch 4 im guessing this battery life is tough.
Not the square case and round screen üò≠ They are the best at screwing everything up.
They are so out of touch with their customer base
"IMHO, the oval screen looks so-so. I bought myself a Galaxy Watch 7 and don't see any point in upgrading yet."
I have a watch 6. Any benefits to upgrading?
Trying to decide whether to keep my Watch 4 Classic or upgrade to Watch 8 Classic. Watch 4 Classic is still running smooth with no issues.
Currently using a Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2.. The 10+ days battery life is too much for me to give up.  Though I love the integration that the galaxy watches provide.
"Kinda bummed, I was waiting for the 8 classic to be my first samsung watch as a 30th birthday present- but am I then only one who thinks the coloured ring (with the nunbers) looks ugly af? üò© I intentionally waited for them to bring back the bezel bc I heard so many good things about it, but I dont get why they had to sacrifice screen space for that ugly ass ring.."
I decided to order it. It's pretty cheap with the credit they give with the phone. And it should be a good upgrade from my 3 that is honestly dreadfully slow at times.
These watches are comically large. Might as well just strap my phone to my arm instead.
i'm upgrading from my GW6
Samsung going back to the Gear Sport
I'm on Watch4. I guess time for an upgrade. I kind of like the design change albeit have to check it out in person.
The 8 classic (46mm) has a smaller display than the regular watch 8 in 44 mm
Fugly is the word I use for its design
"In terms of looks, my watch 6 is like miranda kerr. The 8 is like gary bussey. And i thibk we all know who i'd prefer to spend a night with.  

Samsung, drop the squares from anything watch related. It's why we buy from you."
Currently on the GW5 Bluetooth 44mm. Considering the upgrade to the same version of the GW8 for AU$599. Do y‚Äôall think it‚Äôs worth the upgrade feature & price wise?
"This is why I just replaced my watch 6 classic with a Ticwatch Atlas... Battery life is too little, specially when you do sports that require GPS, I live in a very warm country so the wireless charge was impossible outside due to the heat and now this design :"")"
"I'll stick with my 7, watches are partially about aesthetics for many, I feel the design of the face is just plain ugly. The 7's rounded design especially with the green band and matching face is a real looker."
"I'm going to pre-order, but was hoping for some input on size.  I currently have the GW5, 40mm.  I am a female and have an 8 inch wrist.  Would the 44mm be too large and look to big on my wrist?  Trying to determine is I should stick with the size I have or go up.  Any feedback from people with similar wrist size would be greatly appreciated!"
Are there any changes to the Watch 7 regarding health and life monitors?
"Managed to get the standard 8 44mm for ¬£185 after a trade on of a 6 and PayPal code. Comes with buds, extra strap and duel charger. Not bad."
Only one size? Ugly and dumb. Oversized Flavor Flav wrist clocks are so stupid. Literally just make. 6 classic with better specs and extra button and you're done. What are they thinking?
"Tried the Watch 8 in person today at Best  Buy and I went home and pre-ordered. I will be trading my a little over a month old Watch 7 (bought this along with my S25 Edge)... I know that the squircle is an acquired taste - I actually don't think its that bad. My W7 is in Silver, and I went for graphite this time. I think the black border of the screen and the darker cushion will help mitigate that eye focus towards the stupid cushion lol. Anyway, the watch is thinner, and I know that 11% may not mean much, but boy ... the way it sits on you wrist is just magical. The band appears to be lighter as well. 

Happy to report that when I bought my. W7 44mm LTE, I had all sorts of discounts and it came a little over $200. After trade and discounts, the W8 44mm LTE came out to be a little over $170. 

I am excited!"
Plus the display on the classic is smaller than the 44 mm regular
They should also ditch it on their app icons
This design has me looking at the 7 series instead.
Same. The 5 Pro is the best looking watch.
Same GW5Pro is still the best watch for Samsung Echo
Same. No reason to switch.
"Wonder Chinese smart watch maker can do it, and they blocked me for Gpay ...."
I mean coming from the watch ultra the squircle design kinda grew on me it's honestly not that bad and makes my watch actually feel sturdier than any circular Galaxy watch I've owned.
[deleted]
Imho - no. Watch 6 and Watch 7 still look great.
"I think the processor and sensors are upgraded with the seven, so that would mainly be you. Don't know the specifics though."
I think I'll stick to my Watch 4 classic. Still going to get the new update and is doing the job.
I just picked up a refurbished 6 classic on Amazon for $120.
I went from galaxy watch 7 to the epix gen 2 and I'd never go back to a samsung watch. How I can get 16 days of battery life with the exact same functions is mad to me.
"Same, 6 classic looks wayy better than 8."
Seriously. Still waiting for a small stainless steel model.¬†
"I wanted a classic bezel, but this squircle is ugly as hell and makes me consider trading for a 6 Classic instead or waiting to see if 10s are any better. What was Samsung thinking?"
"Well, it's $37 for me now. I've a student account, and I have $57 in rewards and I  did reservation so that's another $50. Giving me $200 for galaxy watch 7.

You can also go through Rakuten with a referral. You get $30 and I get $30.

">Watch 6 and Watch 7 still look great

No they don't. They look *better*."
"What about sleep tracking etc?   
Curious as I am in the market for a watch and consider Watch 7 or 8"
"When you said 16 days of battery life with same functions i had the urge to google it, but in disappointed. There are no apps. I use my watch for paying, controlling my smart home and texting. Basically i turn it into my second phone when i go outside. The garmin cant do any of that."
Agreed
[deleted]
Is that US? It's crazy how you guys get stuff almost for free.
Facts.
"I mean fair enough with smart home, can't do that. You can pay using it and you can reply to texts. Depends on what's important to you I guess. For fitness etc garmin can't be beat imo"
Oh that's weird
I mean it shows a band on my cart worth 50$ so I think that's where the 50$ reserve went
Yes it is US. I know it is crazy.
"I have the LTE model and it is able to replace my phone when im going for a run. I rely on the Nuki Smart lock app, so i can enter my home. There was a hybrid watch with wearos and something more efficient but i cant remember the name."
"is the FE line like the budget version? so like cheaper but less ""powerful""?"
$899??? What the fuck were they thinking?
"Not a bad idea, but really pricey. Same situation with the S25 Edge. Hope they change their tune after it comes out."
"Just get a RAZR.

Problem solved."
Raising the cost of the normal flip and making this $99 cheaper than a normal Z Flip is lowkey so shady lmaoooo. Did they not think most people would see right through that BS????
$899 just buy a flip 6 for pretty much the exact same price and you get a better processor it's a no brainer
Exynos ü§£ü§£ü§£
"At half the launch price in some amazing deal in a year, maybe.¬†"
This thing sucks exynos chip and a terrible price
Is that the shell of a Flip 6 with the guts of a S24?
this is already 700 on Amazon... maybe 600 in another month?
"This is just the same as regular Flip6 only with sh... exynos and less RAM, and probably with usb-c 2.0"
"yes, but this one is not cheap at all and sucks really bad lol"
"This one sucks, because it's the same price as the better flip 6"
I really thought Flip FE is going to be similar price to motorola razr. Well I know Flip fans are gonna cry but it's just overpriced shit
Exynos hate is so forced
Tell me you haven't tried an exynos SOC in 10 years without telling me you haven't tried an exynos SOC in 10 years.
Its not even bad
"No doubt. You are basically getting a Flip6, with a slower CPU and less memory, at a higher price."
"I had 2 flips, now a fold and will probably go back to a flip next year once this is w years old. I like my Samsung foldables

The 7fe is such a scam,far too expensive and worse than last year's"
"Not really, Exynos nowadays does carry similar performance to snapdragon, however sustained heat is worse on Exynos models, meaning that for people who don't play games or keep up high pressure on their devices it's fine, but if you're keeping up heavy resource usage then the heat bottlenecks Exynos more than snapdragon, the difference is about 20%, also Exynos have a higher idle temperature than snapdragons, fortunately the battery usage is about the same for both chipsets

Snapdragon also has somewhat better video processing and camera details, but Exynos does better on softening pixels on cropped photos.

It's also important to note Exynos has a few bugs when it comes to sleeping or using low power states, for example the Exynos 1380 using a hotspot prevents the device from using its 4 low power cores exclusively, causing a device to usually burn all its battery in 5-6 hours, even if you weren't using it and keeping the screen off.

I think the major problem with Exynos is it's cpu architecture"
[deleted]
It's shit
"Just buy a refurbished Flip6 at that point.

Better in everyway minus scratches."
S22 Snapdragon was bad too.
I have an exynos s24 fe and I have no problems. Hate seems so forced
"Depending on where you live, you could even find a brand new flip 6 for the same price as the flip 7 fe."
I can a flip 6 new (12gb/256gb) for 836‚Ç¨
This guy gets it. Also why the flip got more RAM than the usual Samsung phones? For multitasking?
"I‚Äôm sayin. I get FE is budget but it‚Äôs not that hard to find last years flagship at a reasonable price.

That‚Äôs why they really want people to do trade-in‚Äôs to prevent this situation."

"AI, Galaxy AI, AI, Knox, AI, AI"
AI this AI that. IDC. It's like when iPhone wouldnt shut up Titanium.
These are the hardest watch. TM Roh needs to hand these off to someone else to present
No SPen support on the Fold7 as per the FAQ on the Samsung's website
No S pen support for the fold 7 üòû
no S Pen support on the Fold 7 is awful
"I would love to know how thick the new watches are. Websites always say ""xx thick, without sensors"" no fuck that."
These kinds of presentations just feel really outdated and out-of-touch.
Can someone count how many times they say AI?
"The real deal breaker for me is that interior punch hole camera replacing the under display camera. The LEAST they could have done is move it to the far right corner of the screen, so it wouldn't be in the way of landscape viewing and instead be part of the info bar. Ruins the whole multimedia experience of having that ""large"" screen and a $2000 phone. That's very lazy and stupid design engineering for a company like Samsung. Imagine putting a punch hole on an LG C5, on the middle of the left side of the TV...stupid.

As for the S-Pen...that sucks, makes sense to make it thinner I guess. I myself have the S-pen case on my Fold6, and I've used it on plenty of occasions to justify rather having it and not using it, than not having it and needing to use it. But that specifically isn't a deal breaker, just nice to have."
Them talking so much about AI instead of the actual mew products doesnt make me very excited about things. Also makes me worried about them as well.
Why does the intro music feel like a Nintendo direct haha
Parker whattt
"Comparing last year's Ultra to the Watch 8 Classic is not available. 

And Samsung is not accepting the Ultra as a trade in..."
$2000 for the Fold 7 is ridiculous! And only $800 for my S24 ultra even worse.¬†
"And they're changing the price if you decide not to pick any accessories.

So instead of the $1,999 going down to $1,879, the price goes UP to $2,119

""down"" to $,1999 to ""save"" $120. lmao Plus I don't see my reserve $50 credit

anywhere."
Honestly they should just replace these presenters with the ai they love to bore us about. The whole presentation looks like they have them at gunpoint
I still see no reason to upgrade my S24 Ultra.  What a shame... nothing in the AI seems useful or a time save based on what is already available.  There's nothing new here.
"So, how much AI crap is being shoved down our throats, that no one asked for only for features to be paywalled in the future all whole companies sell our data?"
Why do they all talk like the VIPs on Squid Game?
That guy was doing his laundry underwater!
"I know its not a huge deal and you can fit a bigger battery but with how thin that fold is, its crazy"
"I get this is all about the fold for a while, but honestly I'm not buying a fold for a few years. I'm legit concerned of screen bleed and what not. I do like a ton of the AI stuff, but I'd love to hear more about accessories and what not"
My honest reaction after watching the whole thing: WHERE THE FUCK IS THE TRI FOLD??
"camer bump thicker than the phone, lol (unfolded)"
Samsungs redemption arc after one UI 7
Can't get a 1TB Z Flip? Also cant trade in a S25 Ultra for it at the moment either weird.
"Kinda disappointed... The Fold 7 seems good, though. No Trifold. No UI presentations. Just AI and Knox."
"That pricing across the board is just so disappointing. I get with all the technology prices go up, but being able to afford this stuff is getting out of hand"
"I have the galaxy watch 4 classic and a Z fold 5.  
I hope the battery life on the new watches and the new Z fold are better. At this point, that's all I'm really missing from my devices."
I couldn't give a flying toss about AI
Is the cover screen for the Z Fold 7 feasible for use now?
"The Z Fold 7 has: no UDC, no S Pen, no increase in battery size and a huge main display punch hole for the camera! So many features have been removed however the cost of the phone is extremely high. I'm very disappointed with Samsung!"
Do we have an ETA on when OneUi 8 is rolling out for the S25 series phones?
"It's too bad that there are no size options for the Watch 8 Classic, unlike the 6 Classic. The 43mm watch classic was the perfect size without being glaringly large on my wrist."
The integration seems cool. Lets see if it works.
wheres the pre order credit?
Hello someone knows when they will have one ui 8.0
"As long as Google continues to steal everything from your phone, Samsung talking about privacy and security is moot. No matter how secure Samsung says everything is because ""it's only on your phone"", remember that Google has access to EVERYTHING on your phone. And steals all that data daily. Google now uses Gemini to send all your text messages to Google, even with Gemini turned off. And don't forget about Facebook. They too have access to everything on your phone and are now stealing all of your photos for their own use and data training."
"Pre Order is up. 

https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966ulgexaa/"
"Saw a leak of over $600 for the GW8 Classic. 

I thought $400 was crazy but anything over that is absurd. 

It's hardly justifiable."
"No. I want a bigger battery and will happily sacrifice thinness.

NOBODY is asking for a thinner phone"
"so genuinely, if you dont give a shit about ai or foldables, whats left for you in samsung? theres nothing being said here that isnt foldable garbage or ai getting shoved in our face."
That camera bump is insane
Sooo battery life still sucks on the Watch Ultra lol
"What grates the most is hearing a Brit saying ""zee"" instead of ""zed""."
i hope they show something about project moohan!
honestly hole punch camera on the inner display is a deal breaker for me. the fold can already use its rear camera as a selfie cam while you can still see the screen. ive straight never used my inner camera on my fold 5 or 6 and the fact that it now will take hat screen space on the 7 sucks
Is this where people who weren't going to buy it criticize the phone as if it wasn't good enough to buy?
All I care about is will the Flip7 have a proper flagship camera this time
"I was actually excited for this Unpacked, and this was gunna be the first foldable I'd actually buy now that the camera was at the same level as the Ultras.

But no S-Pen at all is a 100% deal breaker for me. It was already bad enough having to keep the pen in a case. I would think that a device that unfolds into a larger work surface is *exactly* the type of thing that should support hand written input.

Samsung just keeps removing more and more features, and making UI changes no one wants. I've had their phones exclusively for like the last 15 years, but they feel like a joke at this point."
I checked Best Buy out of curiosity for Z fold 7 and they‚Äôre giving 650 trade in for 14 pro max vs Samsungs 450 plus 50 credit. With tax it‚Äôs 1482.49. It‚Äôs Honestly tempting. So if anyone is looking for a better trade in Best Buy might be the way to go
this shi so hard to watchü•Äü•Äüíî
Ready for a $2500 folding phone?
What is Unpacked? I run a Samsung S25 with the most recent update.
Our slimmest Fold yet......
And rest of the phones will get it in April 2026? Slowest android rollout in history of Android.
We want smaller screens too
Does Galaxy have the summary of messages received like iphone on WhatsApp?
Why are all the people in the front rows wearing white. Feels a bit cultist.
AI is the new UI
Sadly...
You forgot Google AI
"To be fair, this AI is pretty revolutionary stuff"
I won't consider it until it has an spen. Become far too dependent on it.
"That immediately killed my desire for the Fold 7, complete deal breaker for me."
"Honestly, I couldnt care less about no spen on the inner screen, i just want it on the outside one for easier quick notes. Easily my most missed feature from my old mote9"
"I'm disappointed as well, but if you have the Fold 6, that pen should work with the Fold 7."
"Roughly 12.6mm for the regular Watch8.

Here it is compared to the Watch7 on the left and Watch6 Classic on the right

."
Ive got a 6 classic to compare them to
"Too much work, Can the AI do it for us?"
You could probably use AI to determine that
The new AI mode on the slimmest Fold can intelligently count the number of times AI is said in the video.
"I'm sure someone will upload a YouTube video soon ""Galaxy Unpacked 25 but it's just AI."""
You're forgetting the far right corner of the screen is where the rear camera sensors reside.
"The first thing they said about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 was something to the effect of it being a revolutionary new product unlike any other folding phone, and nothing they said through the entire broadcast gave me the impression it was anything more than a refinement of the prior iteration. One that was so dead set on making the thing as thin as possible that (going by their total silence on the functionality) they presumably cut any S-pen functionality out of it AND went back to a hole punch camera on the larger display (thus killing a large part of what made the Z Folds stand out from competitos). Not to mention the super thin frame apparently left them no room for (measurable) battery upgrades (how is the thing sporting a smaller capacity battery than my S24 Ultra)."
Is the compare tool working at all for you? I couldn't get it to work for the fold or the watch.
"That ain't even bad, try trading in last year's iPhone or Pixel it's even worse. I would have bought this had they had an enticing trade in offer to switch. I can't even trade in my pixel, they should be trying to attract users of other ecosystems"
reserve credit always takes a bit to show up
Seems to be AI with a phone.
"I love my Fold 6 and I preordered the 7, but man I still miss my S24U sometimes. That was, in my opinion, peak Samsung tech."
"Yup, loss lead, make people dependent on it and then introduce a subscription."
üòÇ
isnt all laundry done in water?
It's really not that crazy. It's just roughly them catching up with the rest of the world
Those three screens in the background just teasing me the entire time...
They'll be breaking $3000 with the trifold. It'll be so expensive that battery life will never be a concern again because you'll be too scared to use it at that price!
(One UI 8 and Android 16 at launch)
"Is that the new ui that was pushed to folds like a mo th ago? Its fucking awful. 100 times out of 100 id rather have notifications and settings combined than have to play the ""am i swiping the top the perfect way to get what I want"" game"
"The Fold6 was already 90% there IMO, a little narrow but plenty usable. I'll post a side by side with the S25 Ultra once we go hands on though."
"What was your holdup on the coverscreen before? Tbh I found even the 3 usable, much the less the 5 or 6"
"[Here's that size by side](https://imgur.com/a/K64CpyK). I have both phones with me if you have anything else you want me to compare.

It is a 21:9 aspect ratio now. Still a little taller than average, but from using it for the past few hours it's more than usable as a regular phone, even more so than the Fold6 was."
Last year's One UI 6.1.1 started its rollout in September for S24 series after it got released in July with the new foldables.
Phew she pricey
"It is live on the website 

**Galaxy Watch8 Classic, 46mm, Black, Bluetooth / Wifi $449.99**¬†~~$499.99~~

**Galaxy Watch8 Classic, 46mm, Black, Bluetooth / Wifi + 4G LTE $494.99**¬†~~$549.99~~"
"The thickness of the Z Folds is one of the most common critiques I see, second only to the crease in the screen¬†"
"A lot of people are asking for thin phones, which is why every foldable maker is trying to make the thinnest foldable."
"There is still the watch and stuff. AI is ridiculous though, I refuse to believe that there is that many people that care about AI"
"Watch, ring, and laptops is about it."
"To be honest, setting aside any AI functionality (of which I find Circle to Search amazing if that even counts, but most of the rest gimmicks I rarely if ever use), I still find the core software on Samsung phones to be the best overall (amongst the various phones I've tried) thanks to a wide assortment of options for customization and productivity that are largely absent from other makers' phones. Stuff like being able to play audio from multiple apps/sources at once, sorting notifications by time received, and being able to change the task switcher to something more compact and easily scrollable is some stuff that generally isn't possible outside Samsung's phones from what I've seen... at least, not without rooting and using some custom OS (which tends to block access to certain apps without workarounds, I hear).

Having never owned a fodable phone, I can't speak on how much of the heavy customization I get in my S24 Ultra would carry over to a Z Fold phone, but I'd hazard a guess the Z Folds in general have the best software of any folding phone... even if Samsung is making some frustrating choices with the hardware and pushing way too hard on the AI stuff (that most people see as pointless gimmicks at best). Same goes for the Samsung flagships imo. Even if they cut out certain hardware features every few iterations of the S/Note/Ultra phones, you're still getting the best (or at least, most customizable) software on any Android phone with (close to) top of the line specs."
The infiltration is real
It's actually just $2k but still higher than the former $1800
Event where they release new stuff
[deleted]
No
"No, but Google is [developing](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-notification-summaries-3533720/) notification summaries possibly for a future Android 16 quarterly platform release, or Android 17. 

If it comes out with an Android 16 QPR update, Galaxy devices would need to wait until the Android 17 update. 

There's also a chance Samsung could develop their own version, and the earliest possibility of that would be in January 2026 with the S26 series launch."
Maybe it's a Samsung Shirt
Those were people all around the world invited through Samsung Members. They were provided with a bunch of merch including a Samsung shirt.
"It's only revolutionary if you're an untalented tech bro who is bitter they can't create art or, well, basically anything."
It is incredible but the dark side is there are many privacy issues. Watch YT vids by Rob Braxman about AI.
"It's another hype cycle. Go back and look what they were saying about 5G 5 or 6 years ago and I was going to change all of our lives. Or NFTs. 

Lollms have a little more utility than that but it's dreadful for the environment and as a consumer facing product they've been terrible. Apple intelligence, Gemini is a default assistant, rabbit r1 these are disasters.  Essential space is a complete joke. Pretty much all development on any other aspects of phones have been completely neglected because shareholders just want to see the word AI same with laptops.

It has been a complete embarrassment and as far as consumer facing products go. Oh boy I can ask my phone to make an image of some random crap that enters my head. 

It's just a glorified word prediction machine and it's wrong 50% of the time!"
Same here
"Complete opposite for me, i'm perfectly fine with only having support on the inner screen as i use my fold as a graphic tablet to draw on !"
"Fold7 has NO spen support. Zero, zilch, nada"
Nope. It doesn't have the digitizer
"That's not a justifiable reason, considering the Pixel 9 Fold Pro also has the rear camera modules in the same location, yet they were able to place the interior camera in the far right corner."
I have an iPhone 14 pro max and I really want a fold phone. 450 dollars trade in. You‚Äôd think Samsung would offer something more for iPhone users who want to switch. Well looks like I‚Äôm going to see what pixel 10 pro fold looks like. Shame one plus dropped the ball on the open 2
Had to activate CC to understand what he was saying.
Not... dry cleaning!!!!
"Ohh i never noticed the 3 displays, thanks for pointing that out."
"Impractical, yes. A cool technology showcase, also yes. Honestly, I just want to see something more aspirational coming from Samsung after so many boring products."
I think you can change the setting to combine it back into one list. I was able to on my phone but I'm not sure about the Fold.
Still don't think it was big enough on the 6. It just needs to be a little bit wider.
"That would be interesting and the only reason I asked is Sammyfans had a post that it could be 'as early as July', so was curious if they said anything about release dates"
"& thats why its best not to trust leaks. 

Thanks for clarifying though."
"looks like i'm not getting a new watch after all, I was hoping to upgrade my old Garmin Vivo Active 4 from 2019"
Ooof
"yea, i sold my fold4 because of its thickness and weight 6  months in... just honestly got tiring to hold and work with.

Pre-ordered this fold though, the camera, thinness and weight solved my main 3 issues."
"Every normal person i interact with at work and my non tech friends say otherwise. And its a complaint I constantly read online.

So im just gonna say outright, thats a lie"
"the AI is very cool especially the integration with alarms and calendars but I agree the amount of times I would use it, it's over talked about here."
Refrigerators and washing machines!
The 1tb model is 2500 without the discount.
I think the restriction is US aviation rules with limit of watt hr on batteries.
Hope it has AI
Nice! I was wondering what was going on.
Im a little suprised at that usecase tbh. The bump in the middle messes me up just writting so I assumed drawing on it was out of the question. Awesome setup since you can work around that though!
There are a couple of sites saying otherwise.
Keep an eye out on best buy during the new pixel fold release. Got my 9XL for free plus a $150 gift card trading in a 14 pro (no contract). Doubt it will be that good come pixel 10 fold release but it'll likely be better than Samsung.
Done in solvent. Still a liquid
"We are going to have to endure years of AI innovation until the next fad comes along. 

So many missed opportunities to be different than anyone else."
"Confirmed, Fold 6

Looks like it's now 21:9 so you should be good
"K, you should really learn about sampling bias. 

It‚Äôs weird that these mega corps are producing phones that, according to you, nobody wants. I wonder why nobody is building a brick of a foldable and just leaving all of those sales on the table. 

Oh right, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not."
I currently use the most recent generation of both (landlords choice) and they are in no way worth the price tbh.
Unfortunately this is the case. Laws that probably won't get updated any time soon with how the US is at the moment.
"I feel like while i can feel the crease while drawing across it, since it doesn't actually affect how the line is traced i don't really mind  
and when i don't feel like going across the crease (like when i don't have a desk to put the phone down on) i can just use one half of the phone to draw which gives more than enough screen space while having the other half for references and as a place to grip"
"The compare table on the Fold 7 product page says ""N/A"" for S Pen support, whereas it says compatible for Fold 6, so I'm taking that as not supported, straight from Samsung. 

https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966udbexaa/"
Samsung.com tech specs show no support unfortunately
I checked Best Buy out of curiosity for Z fold 7 and they‚Äôre giving 650 trade in for 14 pro max. With tax it‚Äôs 1482.49. It‚Äôs Honestly tempting. So if anyone is looking for a better trade in Best Buy might be the way to go
"Yeah, but you said in water!  /s"
"K, they are producing what gives them the highest margin   
you're welcome

Continue in your echo chamber of wrongness."
I mean it is the easiest ever. All the lobby needs to do is donate to certain entities and it'd be done.
"That is pretty good, assuming you already got two or three years out of the phone. 

Put in my pixel 9 XL and they only will give me $360. Kinda disappointing but I also didn't really pay for the phone. But I would be kinda pissed if I paid MSRP and was looking to upgrade."
The only one living in an echo chamber would be you my little guy.
[removed]
It‚Äôll be three years in November. It‚Äôs already paid off and unlocked. When 10 fold comes out I‚Äôll see what google has up their sleeves. I don‚Äôt believe rumors but some are reporting lower pricing
K baby sis
SBF was arrested way before Trump came into office.

"No ""One More Thing""? I was looking for the tri-fold or the project moohan headset."
for real?
Have they already mentioned AI?
"Only the Fold, Flip/FE, and the watches will be unveiled?

update: answer: yes"
No spen support?¬†
S Pen support on Fold7?
Thank you for joining! We hope you have the best time üíØ
Anything about camera system's for s26 series
Any timelines on one ui 8 release ?
Cool
No glass phone like The Expanse yet?
Is there something wrong with the audio or do they just keep repeating AI?
"A tri-fold with S pen was all I was hoping for. Instead, I got my current phone with a better camera and no S Pen. What the hell is Samsung doing...?"
Yes
before the phone
Yes
Saw on another thread that it does not have support for S pen.
You want that? I don't need everyone behind my phone seeing what I do
"Oh there was a phone? lmao  
They mention it so much that you easily forget its that time of the year for the yearly refresh lol"
Very dumb for a 2000 euro phone
yes. I want. Just don't use in front of people.
The S pen is one of my most used features of my Fold 5. This sucks.
"Exactly, I wanted to use it as a mini tablet because Im a uni student"
I hate this kind of practice. They change small things just so you old already bought stuff is not compatible.
What about the watch Ultra? Are the bands for the 8 classic compatible on the old watch ultra?
"I was so hopeful for the Watch 8 series, until I saw the renders and knew it would be a cluster from design to barely being an upgrade to forced new accessories to increased price. The crap trade-ins are just the bonus from Samsung."
"Just pre-ordered a watch 8 classic, and all the bands are ugly as hell... There's nothing aftermarket yet, sadly..."
I was going to buy it to upgrade my existing Galaxy Watch 6... but this change is so disappointing that I will not buy it anymore. Shame on you Samsung!
"So it turns out that they are not at all compatible with each other, this just stopped me from upgrading..."
I was wondering if upgrading from watch 7 to watch 8 for $80 worth it? If I don't when watch 9 comes out trading value will not be the same. Thankyou.
"So far the only band that looks descent (imo) at least for outdoor or sport.

https://preview.redd.it/ttc8ayychvcf1.jpeg?width=1033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cc315398ebd1ed4d01a69c353133a0c6bf43096"
Last year they gave you 2 bands other years the same now change the bands no extra band this why I may not trade up.
I have 50 dollars also but it doesn't seem let me trade in and use 50 dollars
I have so many cute bands. I really didn't do my homework. I'm very upset about this
"Don't they make a metal adapter that could work? I've seen several on Amazon, but I was hoping to see if someone already had bought one and said if it worked or not."
"Do NOT buy adapters. The adapters are right there in front of you. You need an actual watch tool (pictured) and underneath those bands are 22mm spring bars just like a standard watch. Then you can put whatever watch bands you want on.

https://preview.redd.it/i1b7tmxm8ghf1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b39e3d1290a541c292a265b8d6e1510fce5fd1d"
"Just talked to a wearable Product Manager from Samsung. He said the bands for the Galaxy Watch Ultra are NOT compatible with the Galaxy Watch 8 series. Even though they use the same band system, the Watch Ultra's bands are slightly wider."
"https://preview.redd.it/p2y6bcl4zzbf1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c84e06305140ff0a323ff107618bd938579498d

Says here they're interchangeable"
"Yeah, I have a Watch 6 which I have bought several bands for.  This is disappointing and I won't be trading."
"> If I don't when watch 9 comes out trading value will not be the same. 

Wait, what?"
I saw adapters available on Amazon.
"Adapters will work. Ordered a 22mm adapter for mine, 20mm adapter is what you'd need"
"So the metal adapters only work for aftermarket bands from what I have seen, the gapless design of OEM bands would not work. I'm planning on trying to cut and seal that gapless part to see if I could still use my old bands. As of now the ultra and new 8 series are not compatible with each other, soooooo..."
"
I got my hopes up reading this comment, but I'm pretty sure you're looking at the old connection style. Every watch before the 8 and the Ultra used that type of connector, but because Samsung felt like people weren't spending enough money or throwing enough shit in landfills, they totally changed the design. I've tried multiple times to attach a photo of the new (and *not* improved) connection, but it just disappears after a second so...I dunno"
"Here is my watch with the 22mm spring bars on my own watch band:

https://preview.redd.it/74p87gdv8ghf1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5aae5359ccbb10a42a79bc623422153ede30d211

I can see why Samsung wouldn't advertise that in order to sell their own bands. Now you can have whatever 22mm bands you want."
Makes sense. Also they said the watch ultra bands for this year should work on the 2024 model ultra. I like the blue one.
I guess we will need to wait when first users of last years Ultra will get 8 Classic and try to swap bands. For me original 8 Classic bands looks too thin /slim ( at least in photos). I am thinking of upgrading to last years Ultra or new 8 Classic but only if I can put Ultra bands on it.
"Just get an adapter, like '24 Ultra people did and Apple Watch people do."
I meant getting $200 for watch 7 right now but when watch 9 comes out they wont give out 200$ for watch 7.
"So... I ended up buying the adapters... the normal aftermarket bands are too small, so the little pin they come with will push it off. At least for the 20cm bands... I might try the 22cm. I did find a few bands just as good as Samsung for the 8s for like a 1/4 of the cost."
"https://preview.redd.it/l3oegympwshf1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f463bddb4afe4cadf413d20d9d42aab096ad3ac9

You are looking at a Samsung Galaxy Watch8 Classic. Rotating bezel and all. The bands it comes with have the adapters you seek. You just get the watch tool and release the spring bar inside the watch band. It's hidden in there; how else would they get the watch bands on the dynamic lugs? Your Samsung included dynamic lug watch band IS the adapter to use whatever 22mm band you want provided it is compatible with a 22mm spring bar. It's that easy."
"The 2025 Ultra is just a refresh with a new color, more storage, and One UI Watch 8 out of the box, it's otherwise the same device."
I mean if you go to Samsung they clearly show 8/8classic for bands and ultra for other bands. They are clearly different
I just did not possible to reuse band from OLD ultra to classic 8
Can confirm the Ultra band does not fit on the 8 Classic. That was the first thing I tried when I got it this week.
Here's the thing why make the ultra bands not compatible with the 8 series
"Ah, okay. 

Guess I got confused as to what you were saying - thought you meant that something (specific) about the 8 made you realize there would be a value drop for old watches."
"@razerwire1331 band style yes, but connection looks the same as on Ultra. In this pic all bands are from 8 Classic.

https://preview.redd.it/nxv6nbweo6cf1.jpeg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69c806151635bd665fe310d96b8a65698fd22ebe"
Or new ultra completely different system for both the eight and ultra series
The Ultras use a wider band.  Maybe the same size bands on both didn't look good?  I dont know.
Well i just saw i have 50$ reserve credit and 57$ rewards. So I've to pay only 40$
Then that's a no brainer for $40. You will get that back as a extra trade in value or a resale value later on.¬†
Yeah that's what I thought. I ordered.
"All I want is my damn telephoto like the ultra and 45w charging like the entry level devices, It's the only thing that holds me back."
More like raising the price
No SPen support. No buy
It s not raising any bar it's just keeping up with generations ahead competition in order not to become redundant
"If the Samsung Fold 7 had just these three things, no one would‚Äôve been able to resist buying it:

1. Under-display camera ‚Äì Since it's mostly used for video calls, even average quality would‚Äôve been fine.


2. S Pen support ‚Äì Seriously, why did Samsung remove this? It was one of the most useful features, and its removal is a major deal-breaker. Even if the phone got a bit thicker, it would've been worth it.


3. Titanium frame ‚Äì This one‚Äôs optional, but it would‚Äôve made the device stronger and lighter, which is always a plus.



If Samsung had included these, trust me, people would‚Äôve bought it without a second thought. Samsung makes such amazing phones, no doubt about it."
"Same, I miss my s23 ultra cameras, they should both have the same cameras, considering the fold7 is ¬£200 more expensive now. Nobody asked for a slimmer phone üò≠"
"I was waiting for that confirmation as well, guess I'll go with the 6 instead."
"I'm very sad about it but I pulled the trigger anyways. 

Edit: after over a decade of necessity, coming from Note 3 all the way to Note 20 Ultra and eventually to Z-Folds when the Notes got their axe, I don't require the S-Pen for my new career shift, so it wasn't a deal breaker **for me**"
"Yeah, it caught up in thinness and lightness, lost the pen support that was a Samsung hallmark, and is still way behind Chinese brands in battery, both size and speed.

And it‚Äôs $2k for base storage.

Hard pass."
*barring the 2k price lol

It would not make it lighter.  Alumimum is lighter than titanium and all smartphones that say ""made of titanium"" are not 100% titanium.  Just the smallest, thinnest, layer of titanium fused on the outside of what is usually aluminum."
Samsung doesn't see your whole over a decade story they just see a sale as if you never needed it. Also why are you sad if you don't need it?
">I'm very sad about it but I pulled the trigger anyways. 1TB

This is why they remove stuff."
"""I'm very sad about it but I pulled the trigger anyways."" Good sheep"
"exactly, they still fall short of the competition on multiple fronts and have the audacity to call it ""redefining foldables"" through paid articles.

The only bar they raised is of corp greed and astronomical prices."
"You're technically right that aluminum is lighter than titanium by weight, but that's not the whole story in smartphone design.

Titanium is much stronger than aluminum, which means manufacturers can use thinner or less material to achieve the same or even better structural strength. That can reduce overall weight despite titanium‚Äôs higher density.Also, many phones with titanium frames are actually lighter than their aluminum or stainless steel versions, because the internal design is optimized around titanium‚Äôs strength.And even if it's not ""100% titanium,"" that thin outer layer still adds a lot more durability and scratch resistance compared to aluminum. So it‚Äôs not just for looks, it has a real functional advantage.

So yes, a titanium frame can make the phone lighter overall, not just based on the metal's density, but on how efficiently it's used."
I still pick it up every once in a while for photo editing.
"The S-Pen was very useful for me during my last career with engineering drawings and redlines. From the Note 3 to the 20, then the folds.

I just became an inspector and no longer *need* it, so although it's sad, it's not a deal breaker **for me**"
"""No S-Pen support"" really hurts my soul"
"4400 mah, YIKES. Imagine putting a tiny battery in such a big display. And asking for 2200 euros."
Nice to see some real changes this year. The thickness and weigh reduction is very welcome for such a massive device. Especially when Chinese OEM's have been speed running that progression.
Any improves for IP certs? Or still just splash proof?
No S pen= No purchase
"$2000 for base storage? no s-pen, mediocre battery? Hard pass."
Oof that price. Good luck peeps
What's even new in one ui 8
An upgrade for those on the 4 - 5 and 6 have no reason
Does anyone know what the screen-on time is for this phone and the Flip7?
"Im really curious for the Z Flip 7.
Almost same sized battery, but smaller screens to power."
So the cameras are the same as S20
These cameras in a 2000‚Ç¨+ phone is crazy. Absolutely not.
"Agreed. I got into the fold 3 because it added a pen support (was still on a note 9). Swapped to fold 6 last year due to the battery in my fold 3 crapping out


Sad to see I probably won't get another Fold going forward"
i've had a Fold 6 for a year with the Spen case and i used it maybe 3-4 times. I rather have a thiner and lighter device instead
One more hour of battery life than fold6.
"It's good it finally trickled down, but these are really last year's changes. This is a Fold SE from last year with an 8 elite and finally a 16gb RAM option.

I'm just happy it's finally in the states."
IP48
And the trade in values are crap on top of it
"The *option* doesn't affect the thickness, does it? Did they remove a special digitizer or something to shave off the extra 10 microns?"
"they say that every year yet the battery life is always lacking

every year they try to make it thinner and at the same time they make it more efficient, if they kept it the same thickness the improvements would be greater

but anything to beat the market trends, to hell with the customer's use"
"Marketing scheme 
In reality it'll be wayyy less : like minus 1 hour"
How many hours does the battery get almost fully consumed when you simply watch YouTube videos on Z Fold 6?
Imagine not using silicone though ü§¶
"True, that was only Korea sales right?"
They ditched the digitizer to strengthen the display. Titanium layer and thicker glass layer.
Yea it does effect it sadly the reason they ditched it they had two routes leave the phone the same thickness and add the s pen inside the phone but they went against that idea obviously due too practically no one using the pen
"Yes, unfortunately. It's good it's finally coming to the rest of the world."
Sounds like the tri-fold phone will follow the same pattern. Not sure why they have started doing this but I guess Koreans get to be beta testers for the rest of the world.
"Hot take: I don't really want a foldable $2000 phone.  
I want 100W charging on my next flagship phone."
"As long as you're willing to buy brand new watch bands, from what I hear. Old ones won't work anymore, right?"
Sounds like they're wanting to do more with Samsung Health? Maybe this is related?
Why
That makes me like them a whole lot less..
Bro why can't I post
That is horrible.
i think no
"To share wellness data with your doctors, plus remote monitoring health conditions."
"I want to be able to open my camera, hold my phone up to my calendar and have my calendar updated to my phones calendar. Same with my food shopping list."
"Basic photo editing, remove backgrounds, things, people. Nothing else piques my interest.

You can't rely on translator when you don't speak the language at least a little bit yourself (and I rarely am in an environment where my English or ""tourist"" French, Dutch and 3 words of Spanish don't get me forward).  

For generating texts, I have no need for that on a phone or tablet, I'd always use one of my computers for such work. Same for drawing. This is also the reason I'd want an AI service that I can use cross devices and no matter the operating system (I rarely use Windows on my personal machines, for example).

And, this is specially for ""Gemini"" - I have zero interest in talking to my phone - as long as I can't even send a proper SMS via Android Auto's dictation feature (in the past provided by Google Assistant, now by Gemini. Still doesn't understand German too well and has no way to include commas or full stops, has no in sentence word correction and will cease listening after a nano second of a pause.)"
"I would love to see the Samsung spell checker actually become useful. Something like Grammarly on your phone that doesn't say everything is against policy guidelines would be great, it would be nice to be able to turn it on and have it just check whatever text box you are using instead of clicking the little AI thing and pasting it in (Like Grammarly already does)."

"Use of on device llms. They would suck but honestly, it's needed if there is no wifi. Also, I beg for the bare minimum of ai assisted settings pages in apps. Like how often do you need to spend 10m googling how to enable or disable stuff. Also, samsung keyboards auto correct for some reason is fairly unreliable on my phone, so maybe that too."
Gboard still gives me stupid suggestions half the time I am typing.  Perhaps they could improve that before thinking they can do massively more impressive things.
NONE FUCK AI
The ability to uninstall it completely off my phone
"Better battery life I guess. More efficiency. Learn patterns better, idk"
"Self implosion.. never asked for it, don't want it."
"Photo editing, translation and better results for asking questions 

Sadly for the questions part every single AI is completely neutered"
not sure how much they will force it have AI 99% turned off on my s25
I don't want any!
"The main feature I want is a full opt out and turn off. I never needed any Siri, Bixby, Google Assistant type stuff so there is even less AI can do for me because I wasn't already being lazy with my devices.


I don't need it reading my messages. I don't need AI reading my calendar and logging my life. I don't need it looking at my photos. I don't need it stealing my data to inevitably leak, like Meta's AI has been doing. Meta AI has been telling people phone numbers to random people as well as Meta AI request logs being published publicly so you can see clearly personal requests with the person's full name etc.


I have no need for the novelty gimmicks AI currently offers. Currently they're trying to find a justification for investing in AI rather than investing in AI to address a problem. It is a solution to nothing.


If companies want to pay me for my data to train AI with then I would be more open to playing with their toy but that's all it is right now, a toy. It serves no functionality."
"That it analyzes properly work environments. For example, I work as an EHS Engineer, I must walk all over the facilities to encounter risk conditions, and sometimes I don't see some and this has caused me trouble, so I wish for AI to look at them for me."
"""Circle to Search"" is frankly a game-changer for me, the more I came to use it on my Galaxy S24 Ultra. Being able to simply hold home and then select some text (that may not be selectable otherwise) or tap an image to quickly research text or an image in a pop-up window, without having to (manually) open a new tab/app to search in is frequently very convenient. Being able to do similar such stuff with ""Smart Select"" using my S-pen is also quite handy other times. As someone that frequently browses browses/views content in other languages (despite only knowing English well), I'm also a huge fan of the ability to quickly translate stuff in any language to English on this phone, be it by translating the entire screen at any given moment with Circle to Search or by translating text I point the S-pen at with the Air Command menu's Translate option.

Having said all that, the translation functionality is not as simple, fluid, and universal as I imagine it theoretically could be. With Circle to Search, I need to repeatedly hold home and tap translate every time I reach a new screen or see new text. With the S-pen translation, I need to keep pointing at every little bit of foreign text I want to understand. Many browser applications already allow you to automatically translate pages in foreign languages to your own language, but it'd be nice if this functionality was available at a system level, so foreign languages across any app could automatically be translated into your language.

Basic level would just be automatically translating selectable text, but it'd be extra nice if they could also translate text in images and maybe even translate audio (when Live Captions are active). That way, I could say, watch a Japanese-speaking livestreamer in an app like Youtube or Twitch and at least understand what their primarily Japanese-speaking viewers are saying in their chat, plus possibly understand the streamer. Samsung already has AI functionality to translate calls, texts, and spoken conversations, so it'd be nice if this could just be a more universal and automatic thing.

Also, on another note, I log all my meals in Samsung Health and regularly wind up having to add custom foods because the FatSecret database is hardly all-encompassing. However it's a huge hassle to have to enter the food name and up to 15 different nutrient values for every custom food... especially when the order of nutrients on labels isn't too consistent. Would be amazing if there was a function (through AI or otherwise) that let me point my phone camera at a nutritional label to extract the nutrient numbers and populate them in a custom food. Even better if it can analyze an image/table with nutritional details for several items at some (fast) food place and automatically pull the relevant numbers for the item name you specify (cause good god it's an ordeal with some of those nutrition sheets when they have dozens of rows/columns in a static PDF/image)."
"I just want a button that turns it all off. And if I really need to use AI I'll just use a browser version or the app. I hate the fact that 33% of the RAM in the s25 ultra and the z-fold are purpose reserved for AI.¬†


That means effectively the The rest of the phone is running on 8 gigabytes of RAM which is less than the first full head"

"Anything that affects only the user and doesn't depend on liking what the AI outputs directly. (I don't want to be sent AI output, I don't particularly want to see AI images, don't really wanna read AI text, or hear AI audio. AI as an intermediary would make a lot of sense, or just have the outputs be shown to the user).

 It'd be nice if it could do a more advanced library scan (like Music Brainz Picard) and pull images from online to use for album art. It'd also be nice to have better routing options when not driving. I'd like to be able to automate tracked facial blurring/covering in videos. More advanced daily briefing could also be nice, maybe using notification history (like integrating with Canvas/Google Classroom to pull assignment due dates, using GPS to show local events, etc). Smart playlists might be fun (like fitting the activity, weather, traveled to area, etc) (probably removing the very top results if they're too generic).

Pulling info from messages or being able to scan cards in Wallet is nice, so being able to expand that with the camera or a scanner would be cool. More editing and refining options for commands would also be good (like anything that involves ""ads [look up info] to my calendar"").

Being able to disable it would also be really nice ofc. I like having more RAM, processing power, battery, and storage available on my device, so having an off toggle would be nice (even for people that do enjoy using AI sometimes).

Edit: anywhere a company wants to do AI generated images I'd rather have a collage or something. Like, using an AI to select real photos, roughly cut them out and position them together. It'd make it less grating on the eyes. If AI generated text and images are to be used, they should be used in a way that couldn't just be done with a standard chatbot, like generating a description of every photo in a library so it'd be easier to search through, or generating an image of a description and then checking for matches online to use instead or direct to. A way to rough out features/commands could also be nice"
"For work i get a list of customers i need to visit every day, around 8 addresses. When gemini launched i could make a photo of the list and he put all adresses into google maps at once finding the quickest route. Newer version can't do that anymore. 

I want it to be able to make a picture of my family calendar and it synchs it with my phone.

But to be honest it can do many useful things i will never think of in the heat of the moment. So i basically lack an inventory of useful prompts."

"The user's preferences center on enhancing personal data management and automation, independent of direct AI output consumption. Key areas of interest include:

*   **Advanced Media Management:** Implementing a sophisticated library scan, similar to MusicBrainz Picard, to automatically retrieve online album art.
*   **Enhanced Routing Options:** Improving navigation capabilities, particularly for non-driving scenarios.
*   **Automated Content Modification:** Developing automated facial blurring/covering functionalities within video editing.
*   **Intelligent Daily Briefing:** Creating a more comprehensive daily briefing system, potentially integrating with notification history, learning management systems (e.g., Canvas/Google Classroom) for assignment due dates, and utilizing GPS data for local event information.
*   **Smart Playlist Generation:** Developing smart playlists that dynamically adapt to user activities, weather conditions, and geographical locations, with the ability to filter out generic results.
*   **Expanded Data Input Methods:** Expanding data input capabilities by integrating camera and scanner functionalities for information extraction from messages and digital cards.

"I am afraid of upgrading my S21+ down the road and being forced AI stuff. I want nothing! Let me do things manually because I'm not lazy and I don't want to build bad habits of relying on AI to do things for me. 

I hope it becomes a paid service so I don't have to worry about it as much. I hope they lose money on it and remove it altogether from One UI."
They can keep jamming into devices but they can't force me to use it.
The fact this only has one upvote is insane. Been scrolling through the comments for a few minutes and this is the first *really* good idea I've heard.
"> doesn't say everything is against policy guidelines would be great

For real. Why does this seem to happen every time? What even are the guidelines? Lol"
Unfortunately it‚Äôs too late. You are going to need to stop using technology all together. Which wouldn‚Äôt be a bad option at this point with how downhill the internet has gotten over the decades becoming centralized and owned instead of the fun and free wild Wild West of the 90s and early 2000s
Then stop using Samsung. Bye

Its under played but the z-fold 7and s25 ultra technically have 12 GB of RAM. but a third of that is reserved entirely for AI.¬†

That's what pisses me off is they're taking away something that has made my life a little more convenient and replacing it with something that's trying to ruin The job market and the environment and the consumer experience... All to benefit short-term shareholders who see a bump when AI is shoved into products.


That's why Gemini was so lame because they forced it out way before it was ready... It's still not ready but they released it like 2 years ago on every single Android phone with Android 8 or newer.¬†


Was just a artificially inflate the market share by putting it into over half the world smartphones overnight"
"Thanks. 

I picked up an s25 recently because my 16pm was too bulky and I wanted to see the now brief feature which was a disappointment. The camera issues sent me back to my iPhone but I was really hoping that my suggestion was possible through geminis live camera ai feature. It wasn‚Äôt.

I think Samsung should work on Samsung branded ai features. On my Samsung I would live for a Samsung exclusive Ai mode where I can turn on my camera for say, 30-90 seconds and it just does stuff like figure out the time based off clocks in my home then suggest actions. Or, suggest that my fan blades could be dusted off. Eventually consumerism will take hold and if it catches a glance at my stove top, it could suggest cleaning my stove top then give a link to the highest rated stove top cleaners.

I think google is really nailing ai right now. Their press function about their ai glasses was really interesting seeing how they can interact with the world when out and about. So I‚Äôm generally curious if it‚Äôs worth it for Apple and Samsung to invest in AI when google will be able to sell license theirs got many many billions."
"No idea. I've had it flag some of the tamest corporate-speak chats ever. At this point, it's basically unusable because it flags everything."

Lol funny how literally nobody cares about the leak since there is nothing new. The one who did this must be disappointed. Unless they're paid.
Bring back the 10x optical zoom...then I'll consider trading in my S23U.
"Smaller bezels, they removed the camera rings, new chip, and bigger thermals."
"I upgraded to the S24U from a flat S20 (which was from an S7) because I jumped on the hype train of 7 years of OS support. Outside of a freak accident, my target is to not upgrade until at least 2029, but even then my wallet will stay closed if the newest model at that time isn't 75% better overall than the S24U."
For the love of god fix the mother fucking wifi drop issue. You've had 2 generations and done nothing.
Expected the 3x camera to be upgraded next. Which means the main camera will only change in 2027 - the only time I'd care.

"Their main focus (if they want to keep users anyways) should be building camera software from ground up (let‚Äôs be honest, flashy new lenses are not enough if basic issues like shutter lag are present year after year) and fine tuning One UI (not this ‚Äúwell, wait for another update‚Äù tactics), making it work and look better/cleaner.

"One more year with my S22U, yay! 

Julius said thanks"
"I don't need more RAM, I want more battery life."
A 1.2x improvement is not an upgrade any more. Its just slightly better
I'll probably keep my S25 Ultra until Samsung moves to the newest battery technology.  4 extra gigs of RAM and minor camera ring/camera enhancements is not worth an upgrade to me.

I use mine for navigational day for work and all these other companies are switching to silica types of batteries that charge way faster and Samsung is 2 generations behind on battery tech... We are past the point of cameras selling the phone because most cameras in phones are better than the owner's ability to do photography. We are at the point of absolute diminishing returns now with cell phones. If yours has broken and you've paid it off they're usually isn't much reason to upgrade anymore...

I'm sure its all fake but am i the only one who doesn't want smaller bezels? I already struggle to touch things right next to the edge of the screen due to my case... now it they want back to a curved screen we wouldn't have this problem but...

In S26U camera shatter lag will be increased as well

- No camera bump like i have seen on some other threads.
- Use the same camera rings as the s24 ultra. (Not half attached like the s25 ultra).

"Apparently it's a US restriction. There was a rather enlightening article about it recently.

5,000 without being split is as high as they can go."
"uh, they have been at least since S21.  My S22 ultra has Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.  The S26 will probably use Snapdragon 8 Gen 2."
For people who want an early look at tech specs that are usually not that discussed.
"It provides revenue to The people creating the content. An excuse to get us to look at ads and increase consumption. In terms of legitimate consumer of awareness there is very little of utility¬†


There are some exceptions like coverage of changes to privacy or TOS or some kind of anti-consumer thing can be useful to know ahead of time"
"Honestly even if the s26 ultra was perfect for you, I still with lean on the side of trying to grab another gear or two out of your s21 ultra¬†¬†


Not like the 888 chip is meaningfully bottlenecked by any part of Android in 2025. If there's an issue it's probably battery related which can be resolved.


And this is just opinion but the s21 ultra is the last Samsung phone I remember that looked unique. especially if you got the ones with a color camera bump.¬†


You could still use the s21 ultra for another year and wait for the s26 ultra to drop in price.¬†


Or if your phone breaks you could just upgrade to like an s23 or s24 ultra if still want Samsung.¬†


S23 ultra still has the Bluetooth s pen. The 10 times optical. the curved screen although seems like most people don't want that but I kind of like them"
I got the 23+ 2 years ago.  I'm not buying another phone until this one dies or no more security updates.  I'm done!
"Are you sure your phone camera isn't defective? Samsungs Isocell is one of the best out there, maybe behind Sonys Camera sensors, though that has a lot more nuance to it.(Not defending Samsung though, they're pissing me off for different reasons)."
"https://preview.redd.it/u5d8ao155xef1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d2779253010d44cff91ea2bbfbae58222c9b6ff

Just in case the image didn't show in my 1st comment, as it disappeared and showed as (\*)."
But sensors see your heart beat now and track your period. Samsung S26 Ultra.
Lmao
"Leak my ass out, nothing new? 

Instructions unclear"
"I found taking photos of people running, better on my s24u than the s22u. Apart from the night mode, where has it let you down?"
Thats interesting I came from an iPhone 14 pro and like the photos from the s24 ultra more
"Same, really dissapointed with my 25ultra camera. Results were much nicer on my 22u with point & shoot."
S24 ultra camera is awesome
lol the Camera on my S23U is about the same as the S4U and S25U it just never changes lol
Try extensively tweaking it with the options and the Good Lock Module.
"My note 20 was a pile of crap.  I've been stuck with an s22u with not many issues, though its not the one I started with.   Insurance has replaced my phone about 3x since then."
Yeah so the s24 ultra and s25 ultra have an issue where if you have a 2.4ghz and 5.x ghz wifi band comming off your router- the wifi receptor on the phone drops signal like every 30 min or so. Super annoying - as I have legacy stuff that needs the 2.4.
It hasn't been upgraded for years. I'm having better front pictures on my iPhone 12.
I have a 22U works as good as day 1.
I am holding those last updates cause Samsung loves to do enshitfication
"Split the battery into two cells like the OnePlus 13, and you can have up to 40 Wh total."
"Here the source for it or one source. There might be others as well üòä:

https://www.androidauthority.com/phone-battery-transportation-rules-3574123/"
Isn't it 5300 mah per the article?
"S22 had Exynos, S24 also had Exynos, so most likely, S26 will also have it.

Unless you live in the US."
what specs aren't usually discussed?
"It's the post-processing, not the sensors"
[deleted]
"Put ""out"" between Leak and my"
"S10+ had incredible star photography with long exposure. 

S24+ has terrible light exposure between lenses and looks ridiculous when you zoom in while recording.

Difference in picture quality is minimal after what, seven years? iPhone takes the lead by a considerable margin for general use, imo."
"Same here, I came from 15 pro max and got my first Samsung when I realized they were offering more in the ai space. I traded in to get the s24 ultra and the camera is much better in my opinion, as long as you have the fps and quality settings already set for whatever you're trying to capture"
I have such a router. I have s24u. Not s single drop.
"Mine also work good, battery still holds... no need to do anything on my end besides holding update to the new OneUI which I do not care."
"I flew to vegas and back with a 23k mAh, and 3x10k mAh battery packs in my carry on with no issues.  I call BS"
"Yeah, that's fair; In fact, that's my gripe currently. My S22 Ultra used to take really good pictures but now it's having a hard time focusing and the pictures look weird as Hell. Like it's desaturated and has a hazy blurring to it."
It is both. Even with gcam installed on my s24 ultra I cant even come close to what large sensor smartphones can achieve. Phones like Vivo x200 Ultra and Oppo fid X8 ultra are just way ahead.
"I agree, it's shit. At first, it was great, but they just fucked it up with all these updates."
Yea I mean besides trying to capture something moving I think regular 1x shots looks better on my Samsung although it is close in my opinion. Both are great
Cool - its a well documented issue.
"Yeah that's the private transport. Never had any issues here as well.
But I think this is more for the logistics transports. I mean DHL, FedEx, Ups and so on could transport a lot more at the same especially if there is any big phone release like an iPhone especially for the US I think"
"Can you please provide a source? Strange that it works so well for me and all my colleagues, who have the same company phone."
"It appears to be limited to the s24 and s25 ultra. 

If you google s24 ultra wifi issues there are a plethora of articles, support tickets etc."
We all have S24 ultra as the company phone
Glad it works for you and your company
Why would it be a rumor? Just look up the sales.
"See, this is why they don't try to be innovative anymore XD"
Rumor....samsung is the only company that sells 4 phones with the snap 8 eliteü§¶
"If Samsung would stop getting sales, (IMO) this will be in order what they would do: 1. make an ad campaign. 2. Give out great deals. And if everything fails, then they will innovate again, hopefully?"
S25 peeps are lucky they are getting Snapdragon unlike the S24 Exyshit
"I just wish the hardware wasnt so stale. The base S is like 4 gens old at this point. I dont care about the design because its nice and clean. Im talking about hardware, barr the chipset and maybe the display.



Im talking into a wall i know, but a man can wish for change."
"Not that surprising really.  I mean it used to be that you had a much larger selection of quality Android phones.  HTC & LG left the market, Sony phones are difficult to obtain stateside, I would expect that the Android Market Share has increased for both Google _(Pixels)_ and OnePlus, but I think that's mainly due to others dropping out.  _(OP isn't what it used to be IMHO)_ Samsung has a robust ecosystem, unique customization features for their One UI _(Good Lock Rules!)_.  They make solid flagships _(S Series)_, foldables _(Z Series)_, a solid middle tier _(A Series)_ and have even released some good cheap phones like the Galaxy Express.  Since I exited the custom ROM scene and switched from OP to SS, I have been quite satisfied; however, I do worry that the lack of any decent competition"
"Maybe because all better phones are not available world wide as Samsung?

If Huawei wouldn't have been banned Samsung would still innovate"
"I think this has more to do with one ui 7 update release, since that update I know so many people who have moved to Samsung because of it"
Cool
It's bec they're very generous with their coupons.
Not surprised
I'm going to join the team with my next phone
They haven‚Äôt had a true competitor in the flagship space since HTC fell off and had pretty much zero competition once LG exited.
That‚Äôs not very surprising given Samsung makes up the lions share of Android phones sold in most parts of the world.
Makes sense why they tend to stagnate on cutting edge innovation. Why try harder when sales have never been better?
Well they are the face of android
"Check OP‚Äôs comment and post history, it‚Äôs clearly a bot. Please report."
I just bought a Samsung S25 Ultra.  I was a long time Pixel user.  If my Pixel 9 Pro that I bought hadn't had a GPS issue and from my research Google was not going to get around to fixing I might have still been a Pixel user.  I decided to return the Pixel phone and try Samsung.  So far so good.
Sold already? Which phones had that chip?
Not sure you said it first or MKBH
I mean they have the android phone market in their back pocket. Google uses their on chip so who is even left?
And this is exactly why their phones have been getting worse and worse
[deleted]
What do you think ü§î
"Yep. Totally right. The same with Apple 

As Long as we keep buying their phones, same than last year but with a diferent name, they atr gonns contin√∫e doing the same"
[deleted]
"Xiaomi has 4 as well
- Xiaomi 15
- Xiaomi 15 Pro
- Xiaomi 15 Ultra
- Redmi K80 Pro/Poco F7 Ultra

Soon to be: Mix Flip 2"
[deleted]
Soon a fifth one
"Well, it's still significant because it's *the* flagship CPU. It just means that when people make flagship choices, the dominant majority of those choices around the world are directed towards Samsung."
"they have been forced to ""innovate"" already in the mid range line up by adding 120hz oled just to compete with Chinese phones....but for less than 300$ poco f6/f7 are probably the most bang4buck phones out there... Only apple can get away with selling 60hz lcd/low storage high price point due to eco system lock in."
"Redmagic Pros are super impressive but they're not water proof because they have a fan for cooling. (OCed Elite chip lol). I would be snapping one up if I wasn't going to carry this in my pocket all day.

They have 24gbs of ram, overclocked chip, 7000mah battery that gets over 2 days of passive life, vapor chamber + active cooling, 6.8+ inch display with 1.5k resolution, 144hz, and other goodies like the air triggers on 1TB of storage for 999. 650 for the same phone but in an Ultra standard. (12GBs and 256gb.)"
"Chinese OEMs are bringing similar innovations as what Huawei did to some extent, yet Samsung, Apple, or even Google didn't go crazy on R&D for their hardware."
"It's funny how people claim that Samsung sales are declining, yet others claim that they're still selling well, I don't even know why to believe at this point."
"Bot as in like a physical bot ü§°, come on get some life"
"garbage in terms of what? do you mean the ui/optimisation/anything else? As far as stock software goes it really is as good as it can get in the android space, unless I'm missing something?"
About what?
???
"Pixel is going the same way, the P10 is gonna be a 9 refresh
None of the biggest 3 are innovating hugely anymore, only so much you can do till tech becomes reliably usable"
"Since they are still having the most sales and money, so no reason to spend money on new stuff and software. Just recycle the software and hardware from 5 years ago, since the more of the same parts that they produced, the cheaper the parts will be."
"I buy a new iphone every year. I just got a 15 pro because I wanted to sell my 16 Pro before the 17s release and I cannot tell you the difference lol. 

But I‚Äôll be getting the new 17 Air, Fold7, and Flip 7 this year. Because why not, amirite."
"they innovated with foldables on general agreed, but as someone whose used them for years, the fold 3 was the last generation of foldables they innovated on. For the flagships there's at least an excuse since there's hardly any innovation to be had, or at least no one is doing anything new with flagships. But for folds, so many other companies are doing a much better job than Samsung with a fraction of the resources"
"except the first foldable phone was an innovation by chinese company, a quick search would make you less dumb dumb"
To be fair most Chinese phones like Xiaomi aren't really sold in the U.S. and no carrier partnerships....otherwise samsung sales would have been surpassed long ago...
[deleted]
"Tech community has been claiming that Samsung is ""dying"" or ""losing sales"" since 2020 and yet they're still here. Pack it up."
"Chinese phones have very bad software. Say what you want about OneUI's design, but it's functional and has no ads in system apps. MIUI/HyperOS is hyper aggressive about killing background tasks even with tweaks, and has ads in various Xiaomi system apps like Gallery and such.

Plus the F7 is more like 450 euro, unless you're buying straight from AliExpress with no local 2 year warranty and insurance."

"I understand the concern around chinese technology products, but if we want to see these guys innovate, chinese hardware needs to be in the picture. The pace that they‚Äôre innovating on smartphones and EVs is incredible and they carry a ton of value as well."
"Only for this year i can understand Google pixel not innovating, cause they took a a huge (probably biggest among the industry) with Pixel 9

But Apple and Samsung has been doing the same for 4 to 5 years."
"I Mean.. i would totally do the same if i could spend the money hahahaa i have it, but currently paying other stuff .. maybe next year i can leave the dream hahaha"
[deleted]
"Are you sure? Even in the regions where xiaomi is sold, samsung flagships do oversell xiaomi flagships"
"Xiaomi barely has any presence in the ""developed"" Asian markets like Japan or South Korea.¬†"
It‚Äôs because they hear about Sammy not reaching sales goals.  The thing is that doesn‚Äôt translate to a failing business. It translates to the filthy rich with the most stake in the company feel they weren‚Äôt made rich enough in a given year.
"True, despite all this fear mongering, they didn't really ""die"", if anything, they've probably gotten alot better in terms of software, 7 years of OS upgrades compared to a few years ago where phones would barely get more than one, is a big improvement, if it weren't for that, I would never consider upgrading from my Oppo Reno 2 and end up with no updates again.

The people who complain about it are simply a loud minority, most of the people I've met don't really care about this drama."
Losing sales? Surely. Dying? Nope. That's because of the semiconductor division keeping it afloat. But mobile divison hasn't really been profitable.
"Ads in gallery wtf...I would not stop until ads in base apps were eradicated from existence, that shits crazy."
Im a huge fan of OneUI over basic Android. Its been so good for years.
"Poco f7 256gb is 379,- ‚Ç¨ local warranty...f7pro is 470‚Ç¨.....I got the f6 512gb for 320‚Ç¨ few months ago from amazon.de for normal people who just use apps and play games they offer the best performance for the money...haven't heard my son complain about the poco f6....he did complain about the S22ULTRA especially with battery and gaming performance(exynos unfortunately). Only thing he misses is the stalker ultra zoom camera.... I do think one ui is the best overall android skin especially with regards to updates and stability....but with hardware now being so powerfull it's easy to support phones and even the older poco f6 will have support till 2028 and f7 till 2031. Mid range Samsung phones with the weaker exynos cpu did have longer software support but always turn laggy after few years..."
"Yeah I was asking you to be more specific, your flair tells me you're a pixel owner, so I see no reason to hate on OneUI as it's literally just the base ui with extra features. If it's the design/visual aspects you hate then that is completely fine, if it's a technical thing you've gotta be more specific."
Real or fake
It was great from an economical growth perspective but caused an astronomical increase in pollution.
Couldn't be better. All thanks to our captain planet Trump.
Probably not a good idea. I've heard bad things about companies like carshield.
"ICM a big fan of the EV's, especially BYD with what they're doing. The phones and electronics front definitely seems a little too far ahead of the curve if you can understand what I mean, Silicon Carbide batteries are a really neat an exciting tech, but I've got a feeling it's not quite mature enough yet. I've heard phone with 6000mah falling behind or not matching flagships and battery degradation issues. 

Not that I feel like putting them down at all, I find the innovation great. But I could see why it's seen as too risky for them to go for yet. They've definitely influenced Samsung if the rumours of the trifold are true, as from memory they were the first to come out with Tri-fold phones. I'm hoping to see Silicon Carbide refined and brought forward sooner than later, thinking of a 6-7000mAh hour phone with the polish of One UI would be awesome, especially with a better camera set too"
"Royole FlexPai announced at CES 2018 is not using a Samsung panel dumb dumb 

even goes to say Companies are paying loyalties to what? innovation that Chinese local phone manufacturers been making for years after Samsung announced it? loooolll even the Tri Fold that Samsungs been teasing has already been announced by Huawei like what a year already?

dumb dump and womp womp"
Huawei was about to be global no1....now with the anti china Propaganda these phones are barely sold in the u.s. and e.u ..Not all carriers sell them either and some have only started recently. Also samsung spends a lot of money on pre order deals with carriers/shops so often samsung flagships are actually cheaper than Xiaomi flagships when pre ordering in E.U. due to deals/promos.
">That's because of the semiconductor division keeping it afloat

Aren't they losing customers like Google and many others mainly because their foundry isn't great in terms of power efficiency?"
"And they're constantly asking for reviews. I remember getting standard ass ads in the file browser on some Xiaomi a few years back. 

Good hardware, fucked up software."
"True, some people want Samsung to ditch their unique identity with Stock Android for some reason, but I feel like that's pretty much a downgrade in customization since it removes one of the reasons why people would even buy a Samsung phone, and it could make the Pixel look worse, especially with the reputation of their Tensor chips."
"I owned the Samsung s22, i lasted 10 days with it and returned it and went back to iPhone, I also owned 2 Samsung TVs and there Tablets, which also ran One Ui.... The TVs died on me under 2 yrs and the 2nd tv was a expensive one... Both dead Boards and the Samsung tablet is constantly out of ram cuz of all the Samsung Junk running in the background, Yes its the S9 Tablet, I just hate Samsung as a company than they invented One Ui which way worse than Touchwiz.... Why do we need 2 of every app? When the Google Ones just work better...

There thats Why i Hate Samsung so much... I think there a Overhyped priced company there product's arent that Good"
real... Ive owned samsung in the past and i hate it....
Chinese crap. When they start a war would like to see your comments about the most violent dictatorship on the world.
"Mostly Xiaomi and everyone else,"
"Fair, but for those great prices, they had to compensate somewhere."
"Sorry one UI is not worse than touchwiz. 

You‚Äôve kinda lost credibility with that statement. Now it just sounds like trolling. Like why join the sub of a product you hate also?"
Awww. It's sad that you hate it.
I'm not it constantly pops up on my reddit feed it sucks...
"That sounds like a skill issue because I‚Äôm definitely not seeing posts with 80 upvotes in subs I don‚Äôt follow.


Edit: Actually after looking at how often you are dropping comments on Samsung posts, it‚Äôs not a skill issue.  It‚Äôs a weird dishonest Redditor that thinks hating a brand is personality trait. Also if it **just pops up** why do you have a flair.  Jeez man."
I have never seen so much marketing bullshit in a single article

"I've never seen this posted before, So many thanks!  Chronically online people that say stuff is reposted ""all the time"" need to take a chill pill.  Chances are, it will be someone's first time seeing it."

"Since I found out about this today and it's not even something new, I'll be clicking on more stuff from now on."
Why? Does it help with conection?
I did after the post. Idek why it got turned off.
If I often use my device for remote play (PS REMOTE). Do you advise me to activate LS4?

Did u click 7 times on the bottom tile with Inteligent Wifi 7.0.0?

Damn u use the light theme
Forgot to say thanks!

There might be other hidden stuff too but idk
"If i clicked 7 times at everything, I would have known about it earlier, but i haven't searched for it and didn't know there were more hidden stuff"

"It's a good find, ig. Idk why ppl get so mad I am posting this. I didn't know about it, so I thought that others might not know either"
Well shit. Nice find.
Glad to have helped
"I dont think u need any app like Avast on ur phone. Depends on what u are doing with the phone and what ur needs are
 Are u doing something that requires high security or are u using the phone for just daily needs. I've been using Samsung phones for a few years now and I haven't had any problems with the security, so I haven't downloaded additional apps. U can set more security stuff in the settings of samsung if u want."
Its useful for lots of stuff. Good thing they changed it to that
Thxüòä
Maybe ur phone doesn't support it
"Yeah, there are lots of cool settings and features that are waiting to be found and used"
Interesting. Idk how it turned on
U are welcome

Any other examples?

"Ur welcome, broüëä"
I have the Android 15 thing
You maybe can do that with routine. Set GPS area and turn off mobile data?
Are u talking about One UI 7 or?
What phone do u have
"Yeah, I just didnt know about it"
Its the other way around. U can disable stuff if u want to save more battery. U wouldn't be able to disable them if u didnt know about it.ü§´
"It adds more options for the WIFI. U can test stuff, see ur WiFi usage and time, inspect ur WiFi at home, u can see more stuff about ur saved networks and things about ur WIFI as a whole."

"Its intentionally hidden by samsung, its almost the opposite of being a major part of the android operating systemü§£ %90 of people will NEVER need these settings let alone know why you would use them."
First time seeing it so...
"Yeah, I saw lots of posts about the battery too. It should be better (the battery life) we just have to wait for samsung to tweak some stuff ig. Let's just hope they dont just forget or something."
Ima give you my free award because reddit is about to take them away
"Apart from this and developer options, is there anything else you've found?"
Now Im more intelligent lol
How did you figure out it had to be 7 times?? Is it one of their Easter eggs??
It's for low latency. Useful for gaming and stuff but your router has to support L4S otherwise it does nothing.
Switch it on and test your ping.
If you turn labs off and back on it'll reset to off I guess.
"No harm in keeping it on. Negligible workload on the phone. In fact, it might end up saving battery."
Makes a big difference. Thanks!
So I can be on WIFI 6 and use the 5Ghz band? THANKS
"Head to the Gallery settings then click on About Gallery, then click the version number a few times and it'll be added under the gallery settings. This also works for most other Samsung apps, feel free to try it for all of them. You're very welcome!"
Thanksss
"Yeah, just surprised people didn't know."
"Yeah, in the sun it's easier to read"
Ur welcomeüòÖ
I have the s20u too
"ah that makes sense. ig its not stable enough for them to move it out of that hidden settings yet, hopefully it is by oneui 8"
"You can try it in gallery too.. tap on build number 7 times inside gallery's settings and gallery labs will be enabled, not a current samsung user so I don't know if it is still there...I used it on my m30s on Android 11"
!remindme
"Gallery, Health app, Files, there are more I just don't use those features often so I can't remember  all of the apps and settings that have it."
"Yes, this"
Me too tap the 15 hold the shuttle till you blast off i can't beat the game
"Well checked, I've forgot that feature. Thank you"
yea is that the newest one that change the layout and everything ?
"Yeah, and maybe even specific to Samsung. It is definitely more hidden than the developer options."
Same...
"I'm getting the 11:30hrs benchmarked on my device model. So I got no complaints. Battery management tweaks are like endless ... But then there are those who crosspost their battery abuse instead, to another device models sub, or just post a random ss of battery page as if viewers are to divine some imaginary ailment with their batteries from it. I've seen posts with like probably hours of reverse wireless charge and then a ss of battery usage screen to show how bad their Samsung battery is. Trust me, they have no interest in bringing up actual issues or converns if any. They just need to rant in a demented fashion and vent some battery fumes ig."
What can u do with these awards
"There is the one that's in the gallery, and idk about more"
U learn something new every day üòÖ
"When i clicked it, it showed how many times left to unlock it, and since the version is 7.0.0 I thought it would be 7"
Do you have a reliable way to test ping?
"Haven't tried turning them off since I just found out about them, but it can be as u said"
Love to hear that. Ur welcome bro
"Yeah, depends on what ur router has to offer though. Older technology might be used if the router doesn't support newer ones"
"True, although I like dark themed stuff"
U can still use it. it's just a bit experimental if

Thanks! Can't find anything on the health app. Maybe new update ride it
I might have beaten it b4. I wonder what the android 16 game will look like
Nice that helped you. Samsung routines are a great feature
"Depends on what exactly u want to change, but there are lots of stuff that can be customised, yes."
I am happy with my battery life and health as a whole. Maybe we should just focus more on being happy in life.
Give them away
"Very interesting. Thanks! Although I'm fighting with my phone with other issues most of the time I don't even know what ""labs"" are. Or what this WiFi thing helps/changes."
nPerf app. Or Ookla. It may not be as simple as looking at the upfront ping result shown though.
ok because mines definitely doesn't look like that I'm still on 4.1 I think
Idk about you and me but I'm sure Samsung development team is miserably confused with some of the walking talking contradictions they have to deal with.
"For example, if someone gives me one, I can then give it to another?"
What issues do u have?
On what phone tho
"Well, there is a big difference since ur running on an older version. My other phone (the s20u) has one UI 5.1 and is nothing like this i have on the one UI 7"
"Yeah, with so much stuff going on, they should be confused about some things"
"I think so, but I have never used them before"
"I actually had almost the whole thing typed out yesterday. Was on my beach chair sitting a bit in the water to keep cool and I started falling asleep üòÖ next thing I know everything was gone. I was pissed! 

Besides the charging problems, a few weeks ago I (or anyone else who tried) couldn't get my S Pen to lock in place. Then about a week later, I try it and it finally worked. 

Having issues with my voicemails. Been using Samsung phone because it has transcribed voicemails. They're also easy to get to instead of having to call in like I read for the Google phone app. I've had messages disappear (notice it when I go to listen to new message). So I started archiving them to make sure they're saved. Guess what? Those slowly started disappearing as well. Was on it other day and had 4 archived messages left, when I should have about 15-20. Right in front of my eyes the last 4 archived ones were gone. Into the ether. The settings doesn't give you a time limit as to how long you can keep your messages. All I know is that you have a limited amount of space and settings will tell you that you have enough space for 30 more messages, for instance. 

I don't like how we can't delete certain apps from our private folder. And I can't change certain settings because my IT admin only has access to it. I don't have an admin in IT. I don't have an IT dept period. It's just me using the phone. 

There's a few other quirky things I know, just can't recall them right now. 

Then there's my Samsung 6 classic watch. I've tried using the audio recorder on it and when I typically play it back there's no sound. I've used the Shazam app so it could listen to a song. Once it worked. Another time it just kept saying it was still trying to give me the song info and never could (and it wasn't a difficult song)."
S10+ or maybe it doesn't get that update or something
"Same. U gotta pay to get one first, but idk if they are passed after that."
"Damn, I haven't had any of these problems. I dont use voicemail, so idk about that. What IT admin haven't heard of that on a phone till now"
"Yeah, they ended the updates on these phones"
"It's not transferable once someone rewards you that, rather it's a form of appreciation, or if your eligible for the Reddit contribution program, you can cash out some bucks if you get those awards."
"Please tell how it is possible to get around using voicemail? Is it something that can ""safely"" be turned off. I'd rather people not think they are leaving a message that I may never receive access to listen to. Mine hasn't worked properly in the last 2 phones, both androids."
I finally came across the issue and took a screenshot. I'll reply again with the details
"I was in my secure folder and of course have apps that I didn't add and don't want in there. I tried changing some settings for the Samsung contacts app. Music and audio are allowed and you can't change it as ""Don't Allow"" is greyed out so you/we have no control over that permission.  So I pressed on the little info button and it said the following:

Action not allowed

You do not have permission to perform this action. Contact your organization's IT administrator for more information.

Have no clue what I'm supposed to do with that info üôÑ"
Noooooooo it's samsung I should of expected this lol
"Oh, so that's how it is. Thx"
"You can try to turn it off by going into the settings of the phone app and then into voicemail. When u are in there, try to delete the number and leave it blank like that, then save

"They might just be the default apps and things they put there, so their changes are blocked"
Ur updates stopped at 2022
"Got it too, it most certainly is real."
It's just a policy change. They're not going to delete your account if you keep using it.
"Yes, I received it too."
"Wonder if should send them a GDPR message just to find out what they have in that, and who they have shared it with."
"Yep. Got it at the beginning of the year, I think."
"If you have bought anything from the Samsung site the account doesnt get deleted unless you decide to delete it yourself

Its for inactive accounts with no purchases and you would get several emails about it progressively getting closer to the deletion date if they where deleting your account anyway..."
What email address is it from?
Thanks for sharing
It's just an information nothing more

Sent it to Samsung via phishing@samsung.com,fraud@samsung.com,etc
All responses said don't click on link.
Even if it looks like it's official check,header and then go to Samsung. Com directly.¬†
Also make sure it is addressed to you specifically, not dear customer,loyal customer or any other nonsense headings.¬†


ALWAYS GO DIRECTLY TO SITE WHO SENT IT...IGNORE LINKS,ESPECIALLY THISE THAT SAY SIGN IN.


MOST ACCOUNTS HAVE SOME KIND OF PAYMENT ATTACHED,SO BE CAUTIOUS¬†"
OK thank you
I haven't received anything
"sounds like someone traded in their phone with samsung, said they sent it before selling it somewhere else"
great now you can benchmark all day
"Both have 5000 mah so the difference shouldn't be drastic.


It's samsung's doing, s23 ultra should have been a perfectly capable hardware for a few more years to come except for the OS notoriety.


It doesn't even sound right that flagship models become obsolete in just 2-3 years."
"assume you used s23u for 2 years. the s25u battery could be A LOT better tbh. samsung could have had the perfect phone if this phone had 6,000 mAh"
nice
So close to 3k and 10k. It bothers me.
I always wonder if those tests right after purchase are meaningful - if the battery has truly improved or if it's just because it's a new phone being compared to a used one with a worn-out battery
"How about the camera? Ive got an S24 and the picture and video quality its so much worse than my S10e, like obviously worse and way more pixelated."
More powerful than my Laptop Chip lol
"I wish they make a small version of the ultra like somewhere 6.4/6.5in Like it doesnt have to have the S-pen in exchange for the same capacity as the big version. Like..... ""AN ULTRA THAT FITS IN YOUR HAND"". Idk, maybe its just me. Anyways, phone's is a beast tho..."
"Synthetic benchmarks don't mean much in real world experience...

 But big number good, i guess?"
"I don't have a clue what benchmark means, even?? But this comment is funny af! ü§≠üòÜ"
"+1.

Before One UI 7, my S23U has wonderful battery life (I always use light performance profile). But now, it sucks, the drain was unreal. Previously I was comfortable with 80% charging limit, now it won't be enough and I have to charge the battery full if I want to get through the day.

If I buy S25U, I will feel the difference now, but come 2-3 years later, there's no guarantee the same thing won't happen again lol. Unless, they start to use bigger battery."
"I had an s21 ultra, same size battery. I just got a 25 ultra 3 weeks ago. The battery comparison isn't even fuckin close dude. I don't understand how I can get so much screen on time compared to the 21, even when it was new. I was expecting a very slight improvement, I didn't expect it to be this much better."
"Agreed. I have an S23 Ultra right now and I'll probably custom ROM this guy if the battery gets bad. Though for now I'm running all the latest software and the battery lasts easily over a full day, so I'm satisfied."
"I'm certain you'd be surprised. The difference between my S22U and S24 Plus was pretty drastic (from trying to find a plug in two or three times a day to no worries all day battery). Of course, some have better luck, and I did get a battery replacement on the S22U afterwards that helped. 

Also, the new 8 Elite is supposedly super efficient, which helps even more. 

Speaking of longevity and my S22U, it's appallingly laggy. Nothing unusable, but it sure takes a beat for it to load some animations or register certain actions. A Pixel 7 feels much snappier, which is weird considering the more powerful chip set of the S22U."
"Even comparing new to new, the difference is pretty crazy. Obviously the s23 isn't new anymore and the difference now is just so insane, I get worried that I need to charge my phone before heading, only to look down and still see 80%"
I actually put the phone in the freezer as an experiment and got 10k and 3.2k loll
"Even new i was getting MAYBE 7 hours sot on the 23, tested my 25 today and got 10 sot"
"These companies also throttle heavily at first to increase battery life when the review s are being made. Samsung got rid of its performance mode for instance on starting with a z-fold 4 and newer. Have the GOS throttling scandal, had 5 years of flagship phones and tablets delisted from geekbench. 

The fact is Samsung is way behind most Android phones when it comes to charging speeds and battery size and battery tech. Really iPhone Google and Samsung are all pretty embarrassing on this. 

OnePlus Motorola oppo, xiaomi, vivo etc.c.. much better for battery life and charging speeds."
"I thought the same with my s24u and s25u. After reading up on it, it appears the forced post processing can often do more harm than good. I grabbed the camera assist from the Samsung app store and turned off picture softening and distortion correction and turned on prioritize focus over zoom. Made a big difference. There are some other advanced options in there which may help. Not sure why Samsung wouldn't include those options in the base camera app."
Your s24 shouldn't look worse. I went from an lg v30 > s20 features > s23 ultra > s25 ultra and cameras have only gotten better¬†
"Yea I'm not sure why Samsung doesnt offer that. Id say their base is in-between the pro and non pro iPhones and pixels in terms of performance and features, so I guess they skipped out on it because it would be niche? they are in a strange spot compared to others, non pro (pixel and iPhone < base Samsung < pro (pixel and iphone) like a middle ground"
It definitely means something. I do photo editing on my phone and the 25 ultra is so so much smoother¬†
"Benchmark is basically testing the performance of tech, in this case the cpu"
"I was only getting 6 MAYBE 7 hours sot on my 23 ultra brand new, I'm getting 9 easily, maybe 10 if I pushed it on the 25 ultra. Maybe I had a defective unit or something, but I've noticed a huge difference¬†"
"Agreed! I wish Samsung worked on this, they ought to support in real sense for the flagships atleast. The 4/5 years updates are unviable."
I have a high mid range samsung and i feel this version drains the battery too much
"Not surprising. I try to keep the stock out of box firmware for as long as possible, that one gives max backup."
"Good for you with the official update! Mine pulled the backup to less than 12 hours compared to 24+ hrs on the same usage. This was back in 2024, whatever update was latest in Feb. I traded for S23 base, primarily due to ergonomics issue with s23u and the worse battery backup.
The custom rom route isn't as bright as it used to be due to samsung locking the bootloader. Let me know if you find/know of any nice roms."
"S22 ultra had 8g1 chip it was fabricated by Samsung instead of TSMC and is notoriously inefficient and terrible for battery.  8g1 and 888 we're both terrible chips but anything fabricated by TSMC you're not going to notice the performance difference in any meaningful way. 8g1, 8g3, 865,  etc .... All of that stuff is plenty powerful for 99% of consumer facing things. 

Absolutely do not need to upgrade your flagship phone every 2 years to get decent performance that is absurd. Name me one thing 8g2 chip cannot accomplish that the newer chips can? 

There's a chance you were noticing things based on placebo because you know it's newer hardware and you're trying to come up with internal justifications to buy something. 

But believe me, the 8g2, Even the eight plus Gen 1 which was TSMC they have aged perfectly fine. 

With the outside of maybe a tiny fraction of graphically intense games you are not going to notice the difference between a chip from 3 years ago and a chip from now so long as it wasn't fabricated by Samsung like the 8g1, tensor or 888 or exynos"
"Understandable and expected. It's the updates. I remember, my s23u also ran butter smooth till I updated it. With the updates, the consequent lag, one feels for that erstwhile snappiness and then comes the new launch, a very predictable pattern. Think of it, corporations sell products not to satisfy customers but to maximize their profits. It's a simple sad reality."
"After how long though? End of the day is impressive, 20 minutes is not lol.

Glad you're enjoying it. Worth the upgrade?"
Nice
"Ill download that app and have a play with it, starting with the setrings you modified. Thanks for sharing that knowledge."
"Actually if you used the 10x optical in good lightning on the S23 Ultra, it's clearly better than the 5x optical on the 24/25 cropped in to the same level"
"That was my initial thought, pictures should be way better than my 6 yo S10, but the quality and pixelisation downgrade was the first thing i saw after buying the s24. I 100% confirm to you my s10e was better. I will try the new settings people have suggested in the comments for my s24. Cheers"
"Exactly right? I truly it would appeal the masses, especially the young ones or the gen Zs cuz as far as im aware, they only appeal to adults or simply parenthood individuals. I hope they organize their line'up too like literally... Simply like how pixel and apple do theirs, if they're going to keep copying each other anyways..."
Try the 3D Mark Wild Life Extreme Stability Test and see if it can hold that performance for more than 15 mins. Just a warning that the test takes 23 minutes and your phone will get really hot
Same bro I do porn editing and the 25 ultra has a huge improvement imo
No one does Real photo editing on a phone because they don't have desktop level software. Just like android phones can't edit 10 bit files¬†
"I've been through OneUI 5, oneui 6, 6.1, and 7, and there's no battery difference for me, it still holds all day. I bet that 90% of people saying that their battery got worse is actually just a psychological thing. There are people like this everywhere, and I hate them."
">8g1 chip it was fabricated by Samsung instead of TSMC and is notoriously inefficient and terrible for battery.

I'm seeing a pattern here, anything made by Samsung tends to be shit"
"After quite a few hours. Today, used my phone for a few hours, went to work at 12pm, got off at 10pm, battery was at 68%. I did a test the other day, had a day off to waste, got 9 hours sot plus a few hours of screen off + music on a Bluetooth speaker on one charge, with 120hz on¬†"
"i have both my s25 ultra and s23 ultra in hand. yes, in broad daylight in perfect lighting the 10x is better but in every other scenario the s25u 5x is so so much better just because the sensor itself is so much better. really wish samsung wouldve kept the 10x and used the better sensor in it and the 3x. a dual 50mp 3x and 10x would make so so much more sense than a 10mp 3x and a 50mp 5x and would perform better. the current 3x is awful compared to the other 3"
That's really weird.. did you turn down your screen resolution to 720p? I had issues with camera in the past and it turned out to be because of 720p
Your dream may have came true. Look at s26 pro leaks
Ayo what?????
"um, not true at all.. my sony raw files are 14 bit, edited on my phone through lightroom.... I much prefer using my phone over my pc for editing in laggy lightroom. The only things I'm missing out on on my phones version is ai denoise really."
"90% of my ""real"" photo editing I do on a desktop is often just a bit of exposure adjustment, maybe a touch of color grading and some masking if I'm feeling fancy. All of that can easily be done on a phone if you want to. Also, who TF designated some editing as ""real"" and other editing as somehow ""not real""?"
"Like I said, good for you sir, no need to hate anyone :) Also, it will be dependent on multiple factors, if yours stays good after each and every update then you can ignore these posts."
Thanks for clarifying. Those are some pretty good numbers. Nice one üôÇ
"Haven't changed any settings since i bought it, so unless it comes with lower settings as default. I'll go and find out where that 720p screen resolution setting is at and make sure its up."
"Second this, LrC is laggy on my desktop for some reason. Also I get a much more colour accurate display with my phone. AI denoise on PC creates weird artifacts with faces anyways lol"
"Yessir and those over 9 hours of sot was video play back like Instagram or YouTube. I'm sure if you were doing something like reading or scrolling Facebook or forums or something lower battery consuming, or apparently clash of clans (consumes less battery than YouTube for some reason...) then I'm sure you can get like 10 or 11 hours sot easily. That's a little harder for me to test because I can't just leave it running like I can a video loll"
Usually the screen setting is set at a lower than possible option to improve battery life I believe.
"Seriously lol, first time I ever got my PC, i started editing photos, and when I pulled them up on my phone, contrast and colors were way off. I even have an oled monitor and there was STILL a huge difference. And I have a somewhat beefy PC with plenty of ram, and lightelroom is STILL buggy on it. My 23 ultra lagged somewhat but this 25 is doing great. Turned on ram plus to hopefully help in lightroom"

"using AI reduces brain function by an absurd amount, just fyi.."
Need more CAPSLOCK .
Samsung's AI has never been very good with profanity. I always have to add words to the internal dictionary when I get a new phone or else you end up with ducks everywhere.
I can tell you is better that the iPhone
"What on earth is this post? Are you seriously screaming into reddit about generative ""AI"" on a Samsung keyboard? Why are you using Samsung keyboard when Gboard exists? What is compelling you to use the literal most notoriously bad keyboard on android? Why are you getting upset about such a basic thing you can do easily and accessibly change? You're angry that the phone won't curse for you? What are you rambling about seriously put your energy somewhere else this is such a non issue."
"Dude I hate to be you but you have no idea how moralising the reddit community is, it's all first class geniuses, you must be feeling like you're on your own in this place. There you go an upvote, just for the fact that a billion dollars company needs actually to address this without 3rd party stuff jumping in."

Welcome to r/Samsung"
"gBoArD eXiSts, lmao."
Samsung Keyboard is actually the most customisable one of them all
"üôÑ Samsung keyboard is notable garbage. This has been known for 10 years. It's default, it's not good. It's not advisable for use."
"I find it decent enough for my use case, and I don't want to change for no reason."
Used it back in 2013 because I could swipe type while the aosp one couldn't.
What an ignorant way to stumble through life. Decent enough. You have an android phone with ultimate customization but you'll settle for mediocre half functional decent enough. That's an iOS mindset lol

Tldr you didn't listen to the reviews and got the worse product.
"> and make their names public so other companies would not accidentally hire them too.

Yeah, that part is not happening in this reality. Samsung would be sued to hell and back for that."
"That's not a sign of incompetence but of a strategy of product and consumer lock in. They want people to buy Samsung products, so making certain features only work with Samsung products is a conscious choice.

You might not like it, but it doesn't make it incompetent."
"Sound on buds 3 pro is spectacular, as is phone call quality."
"Samsung buds 3 pro are lauchably bad, honestly.

I've got Redmi buds 5 too and first of all, they sound better (on Samsung phone). You can tell that's subjective, so how about that:

Redmi ones have bluetooth in the case, Samsung doesn't (you need to have one bud in the case to see case battery)

Redmi I had zero problems with charging while Samsung can sometimes not charge one bud untill I move it slightly in the case

And the Redmi ones costed me fraction of Samsung buds 3 pro. The design is nice and noise reduction works better, but that's it. Its overpriced mid product and I'm surely never buying from them again."
Samsung becomes more and more like Apple.¬†
"It's a good thing that they're helping competitions. My issues with their phones drove me to use another brand, Xiaomi, and their earbuds, Edifier."
Except the opposite happened. I know other people who chose other earbuds because of that.
"The problem is they will lock you in for unique features then start dropping them, so what's the point?
Look at what they are doing with their S Pen fan base."
"I ended up ordering Huawei FreeBuds 4 Pro for call quality and multipoint. But now given what they are going to do with Note heritage and stylus, I will research other phones too. So sad."
"And there's plenty of people who aren't bothered or aren't tech inclined enough to care. You and others moving away probably aren't moving the needle enough. Though I only looked into it briefly, it seems like most of the headphones and earbuds lack the feature and only really recently started picking up in number, which is might be another reason they ignored it."
"Will I be able to remove some of the default stuff? Wondering if I might be able to use it like a micro widget. The 'dynamic island' concept is a masterpiece of marketing, dressing up the huge notch in the display as something useful. They could have done something similar on a notchless screen."
Is one ui 8 stable yet
The now bar is a cool idea with basically no use as of right now other than pissing me off changing music. More usefulness sounds great. I wish I could have the old Spotify widget on lock back though.
"This will not succeed until Android offers a standard api for this.

I tried to use it for nba scores and it never worked."
"Live notifications hmm sounds like Windows Phove Live Tiles, they were great 

If they can get it to work, hopefully"
"I just want to be able have the date up by the clock in the left corner and the screen not fade out in 10 seconds when using the phone - without an additional app - but no, just UI changes for their own sake."
"Step in the right direction.

Now give lock screen depth effect and native app lock feature. 

Come on man, it's not much we're asking for. Takes a simple tweak.

And oh, how can i forget that tiny ass signal icons which do not match with the big battery icon at all.

They just made battery icon big but left rest as it is. Talking about absolute dumb behavior"
"ya, dont care. just want to see the time / date if my phone is locked. I don't want anyone seeing anything beyond that, including myself, or when i'm sleeping"
Damn I wish I could get UI 7 on my one year old phone that was promised 7 years of updates
"The OneUI 7 beta program for the S24 series commenced in December 2024. Based on the provided [launch timeframe](https://i.imgur.com/pnZKHJN.jpeg) for OneUI 7 deployment, and considering the specific device model, the update rollout timeline could potentially span 4 to 7 months from the beta launch. This projection is derived from the company's recent update history and represents a preliminary assessment based on available data."
"Oh, that totally won't be abused and totally won't be annoying to have."
At this point Samsung might as well go ahead and use iOS as base branch and slap One UI on top of it
You already can - just go to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Now Bar and you can edit the default Live Notifications.
"No. Samsung just released Beta 3 on Monday. The Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, expected to launch next week, will ship with One UI 8 out of the box, but we don't know when the stable update will roll out for other devices."
I think it's a good idea but yeah at the moment it nothing
There's a way to add the Spotify widget with good lock (I believe). Saw a video about it on Tiktok. I'll try linking
"This was right from the tldr at the top of the article :

- Samsung‚Äôs One UI 8 will enhance its Live Notifications feature by adopting Android 16‚Äôs new ‚ÄúLive Updates‚Äù API for broader third-party app support.

- This new API allows any app to create live, ongoing notifications, a major improvement from the previous version limited to mostly first-party Samsung apps.

It looks like a standard API to me."
"Wait people like UI 7. It's the worst downgrade I have seen. By far worst app icon design. Notification bar is just next level bad.¬†


Lock screen sometimes doesn't show notifications sometimes it does. It's buggy.¬†


It's a mess"
You can disable Live Notifications/Live Updates on a per-app basis.
All I get are media (sadly not Sonos) and things like 'it's a new day' or similar. The weather bit is useful ish and the calendar. I tend to have those things on my home screen anyway.
"The OneUI 7 beta for S24 series launched in December of 2024, and then heres a screenshot of the [launch timeframe](https://i.imgur.com/pnZKHJN.jpeg) for OneUI 7 to devices. So from this information, and depending on your exact device, you could ascertain it would take them anywhere from 4-7 months from when they start the betas until you receive the update. I'm not saying that's correct, or will happen. But based purely from their most recent track record, that is my assumption, and the best information I can gather myself."
"I wonder if Samsung will stop developing their version of Live Updates now that Android is implementing their own universal way.

Because there would be no point of Samsung continuing their own work om Live Updates  if every app just uses Google's implementation instead. 

Unless Samsung's version has more features and they continue to develop it just for their own apps and any 3rd party apps who volunteer to use it. 

And of course since Android updates are so fragmented like 80% of older and non Samsung phones won't get any form of Live Updates at all (stuck on older Android versions.) ü§£"
There's just some features on Goodlock that I think they only made available on UI 7 that I want try ness with lol
Given how many apps are increasingly using notifications to just out right spam the user with ads disabling notifications is just becoming a default behavior for most apps.
"Sonos is a whole issue and that's a problem on their end.

Let's wait for this software to be stable before we start asking them to add stuff back in."
"One ui 7 was an exception and something nevee seen before for Samsung. Should go back to normal with one ui 8, so I expect the stable version to be released at the end of July/beginning of Aufust for the s25 series"
"Why is it even called tri-fold? Despite having 3 screens, it folds two times, not three."
"They should get the bifold under control before they move on to trifold. The more they release about the Fold 7, the less impressive it is. Samsung is falling behind and I cant seem to figure out why. Are they saving it up for a giant amazing launch? They cant go from innovative to Apple that quickly."
I want a 16 panel phone the unfolds upwards and sideways‚Ä¶like those of paper maps!
Who's even buying these?
Why care about battery life and size in other phones when a folding tablet is clearly what everyone wants
Doing everything but changing the camera hardware üò≠üôèüèø

Just hope samsung really steps up the durability this time. These foldables need to be backed up with stronger hinge and a better warranty.
"People who love the latest tech.  If money was no object, I would for the cool factor.

If you could get some insane screen on time it might. Be nice for watching movies in a scenario e where a tablet is inconvenient to carry."
I'll wait for the six-fold  /s
"I honestly just dont understand why people keep buying these. The screens usually break between 7 months to a year and they are expensive af, also isnt that thing going to be thick af in your pocket? Also when it is unfolded will the magnets be strong enough to hold it in tablet form without needing to hold it open or in a weird"
WhO aSkEd FoR tHiS lol. Love these comments.
Going to be over 3k
"Haven't foldables generally been a bit of a failure? 

They were never going to replace regular phones, and by their very nature they're less durable (and this won't be able to last as long as increasing numbers of people are expecting their >$1500 mobile device to).

Current estimates say that foldables will constitute *at best* 6% of the smartphone market by 2030. Though I doubt that a bit because they already seem to stagnating - there's not much else they can physically offer in that form factor, and there just aren't any materials simultaneously strong and flexible enough to make them genuinely durable. 

It's not even that they're too far ahead of their time, it's just that most people don't see the point of foldables. It's not like they offer anything new that you actually need."
"Samsung's launching tri-fold screens, too... Maybe I will buy one as I just love split-screen functionality. Looks satisfying to control the screens."
"Yes, I want one. Get that out of that way. Can we get ahead of this bullshit and call them a tripanel phone line they are? Or duofold. Any fucking thing what besides the most wrong nomenclature possible."
"It will have a shit camera for sure, and Samsung will take 3 years to put a 200mp camera on their trifold"
"No,  just no. Just something to break easy."
Who the fuck asked for this?
"Unless I'm missing something, they seem to be bringing products nobody really wants and not enhancing where they could the products that people already love."
Trifold is pointless.
"The regular fold is kinda cool, but more than one fold is a joke"
"Bad name, probably short for tri-screen fold."
It's similar to a tri fold wallet that folds twice into 3 sections. The tri describes the sections when opened. Like a bifold wallet fold once into 2 sections.
How about bi-fold?
"It has tri(three) screens and folds, so trifold"
"What is less impressive that you know now that you thought you did before? Every single iteration of the fold has only gotten better. The crease is basically non-existent now and the 7 is stupid thin, which was a major hangup for a lot of people. Sounds like manufactured outrage."
"I wouldn't mind, if I had the money üôÉ"
You mean you dont want a $4700 cellphone with the same specs your $1100 phone from 4yrs ago had?
"Sigh guilty. I've been rocking the folds for the last 4 years. I actually really loved it, I'd probably get this lol"
I absolutely will be.
People who watched Westworld
"Exactly, I don't understand all these people crying about batteries. Just plug it in when the battery gets low."
"Nope, they said probably 2025."
This is why insurance exists
I've been asking.
They got a market to compete in
Me.
"I agree with you, though I think we are at a technological standstill with battery life"
I'm sure it'll have a market. The aspect ratio of a lot of current folds isn't great for media. Could likely have a more traditional one with these.
Yours still works fine? No creek or screen failing?
"Its because the technology exists and they very easily CAN put much bigger, much faster charging batteries in them. They CHOOSE not to"
I think they meant price in Euros
"Yeah still works good, no screen issues at all. Within the past month I do get a faint sound from the hinge when opening fully but it still closes and opens completely. Screen inside has no issues and this model which, is the Fold 4, I've had for two years now. I did keep the inside screen protector on almost the entire time which I think I removed it about 6 months ago because of dust. My old one, which was the Fold 2, I also had for about two years, didn't have any problems with it at all but that one was leased and upgraded to the new iPhone for my SO and just bought this one. I was thinking about upgrading soon so this might sound like perfect timing."
"They choose not to because it isn't needed. There are outlets available everywhere, all the time. Most phones have fast charging where 10 minutes plugged to the wall gets like a 30-40% charge.

If for some strange reason you can't be around a wall outlet for a few hours, either plan ahead to charge your phone or buy a $20 backup battery to keep in the glove box or an EDC bag. 

A larger battery is just a waste of space, makes a larger heavier phone."
"You're entitled to your opinion, but I doubt anyone would ever embarrass themselves by posting a European price online. Lol. Nice one though. Very humorous effort."
Oh good. Seems like they have improved significantly since I last check any news on them. Might not be bad then if durability is significantly up. Price will be a big factor though ü´†. They keep going up after all
"Except Silicon Carbide batteries are LIGHTER and SMALLER, so both your reasons are wrong on that :) With recent advancements they last longer as well. 

You also need to take that into account. A 4400mah battery will degrade over time. It'll be okay the first few months, but then it'll get worse, and worse, and worse.

When you can have a battery that's smaller, lighter, has a higher energy capacity, and degrades slower, the choice to have a simply worse battery in a multi thousand dollar flagship phone makes no sense.

The only reason they're leaving an awful outdated battery in the fold 7 is that they can use the new bigger battery as a reason to get people to upgrade to the fold 8 or 9 later on."
"Yeah I was concerned when I first got the Fold 2 after hearing all the news around it but ended up just giving it a try and see what happens after messing around with it in the store. I'm a huge fan of Westworld and always wanted something like the phones they had that turned into tablets, thought it was cool as hell. But yes price is a huge issue for me too, just kinda crazy to spend $1k+ on a phone. This one I only did cause I enjoyed the last one, so we'll see where the next one actually decides to settle at or what they'll offer again."
"Silicon carbide batteare more expensive, and unnecessary.
Current phone batteries are just fine. Just charge as needed."
Samsung usually pretty aggressive with deals in USA. Iwas¬† just worried about the durability aspect because earlier videos of the foldables were not pretty.¬†
"You're looking at literally roughly a $10 increase to the manufacturing cost. I don't want ""just fine"" on a phone over $2000. Make it $2010 and give me a 5600 mah battery that's lighter, smaller, and overall better please :)"
No.
"Oh man I've been going back and forth about getting a foldable, if this is real then I'm definitely getting it day one"
"I didn't know I wanted one.

I now know I want one üòç"
I'm confused on the layout
"Scroll down in the link, i was aswell but they cover it. I'm unsure, i think the normal folds are more my thing."

What does the camera have to do with UWB?
"It's still using UWB to determine the distance and direction, so I'd say no.  Also, they still claim the S25 has UWB, so they'd be on the hook for serious class action damages if two series, and multiple models, didn't have a feature they claim."
"Only the Galaxy plus models and ultra models 
have UWB"
Oh Samsung... ü§°
"Well it does and doesn't.  The camera isn't necessary for UWB, but it is necessary for the ""AR"" feature which uses the camera display to show you where the tracker device is (approximately).  Between using the display which just shows distance and direction and using the display which shows the surroundings from the camera, the latter is clearly much better.  And unfortunately on many of these devices the AR feature doesn't work."

It's in connection preferences you got to toggle it on
"without taking the battery out... no.. unless your software has ""battery protection"" settings."
"Root and advanced charger controller (ACC) or

https://www.reddit.com/r/SamsungDex/comments/k1491q/s8_without_battery/"
smasnug!
You need to root it then you can install an app for that.
"Its almost impossible for battery bypass if you don't root, also if you can't stand too complicated operations, just limit the power manually, charge till 30% battery."
"Just limit charging to 80% and there shouldn't be any bloat issues.  It may still affect lifespan of the battery, but I'd guess you're never planning on using this device as a phone again, so you don't care about the battery only lasting 12 hours at some point."
which batt protection setting if I may ask?
Root Trips knox forever plus OP wont be able to get some apps
"Ah thanks, where may I get ACC & how to root an S8? (I've only root older phones from the 2000s hehe). Also the comment you link goes to the main post, maybe screenshot if its ok."
"oh my bad, thanks I fixed it"
"which app specifically? Here someone commented ACC, any other?"
"oh ok, one thing is that im using a usb hub for hdmi & mouse, so any way I can set it just for data & not charge?"
"That's also an issue, there's no setting to limit charging on Android 9, any app/root that can do it?"
"There's no API apps can use to check Knox. Apps use play integrity, which you probably don't pass strong integrity anyway because phone isn't updated for years now. OP has an xcover 6 pro. OP is completely fine."
"From GitHub and you use magisk to root and it has instructions also on GitHub.

I linked the whole post, it's not hard to see the 14 comments on there."
Ya that's the app I was talking about. But there's definitely more though.
"Use ACC but not app version (AccA) which is deprecated. Use new devs version for Magisk/Ksu from telegram channel. I use it on my S10+, also if I have battery protection with ACC I control more settings as max battery temperature to charge, or can schedule max battery charging for morning and night"
"Oh, I'm pretty sure Samsung had that feature before Android, but maybe not that early?  I don't remember when that was added.  Not sure about root apps, which I suspect you'd need.  I don't think without root an app would work.

With something that old you could also consider a custom ROM, but I don't have any suggestions on that.  That might be better than merely rooting to get better security updates."
"Ah alr alr ty. also my bad i thought you linked a comment hehe, ty"
"Alr, thankss"
"alr thanks, any way to root with no data loss tho? using SM-G955F¬†"
"Oh ok, thanks then"
If I'm not wrong there is no way to root without data loss
"Thinking about this further, I'd swear my S4 had that battery charge feature, but maybe I'm mis-remembering.  Oh might want to double check your settings possibilities."
Unlocking the bootloader is where you lose data...not rooting per say
"sadly I've checked for an hour, both google & my phone, couldn't find anything"
Definitely not on my oneui 2 phone. Had an S3 mini and it never had it too. Must have added it in oneui 4
"That's right, I didn't remember if you already lost data when you unlock the bootloader. I unlocked it years ago and I had forgotten"
"I have a hard enough time remembering my phone model numbers, so I'm not going to remember those various versions!  ;-)

As my comment indicated, I don't even trust my memory on what the S4 did."
"In my general experience, the bigger a company are, the worse the customer service becomes."
"Yes. I bought an S8 Ultra tablet in early 2022 with a new S22U; there were a ton of promotions going on, many discounts, but the one thing that really got me to buy the tablet was the offering of a free keyboard cover.

That cover worked like twice, and never has since. I tried to get it replaced but was told none were in stock. I checked back in months later, was told that I was being sent one. Another month later, nothing, so I co tact them again and am told there's no record of any of that. But of course no replacement is currently available. Then another ticket was logged for me but of course nothing ever came of it either and I just had to accept the BS of receiving a faulty product that will never get replaced.

And now just look at the S22U overheating debacle after the 6.1 update last year. Mine fell victim to it but Samsung has yet to acknowledge anything. They don't care and hope we will all just go away cause our phones were all out of warranty."

"I havent had issues either but in the last year or 2, somehow criminals are getting tracking #s of deliveries, especially of iPhones, and they are tracking them and stealing them shortly after delivery.

The only reason I go through Samsung instead of buying it retail at best buy is for the tradein and EPP discounts that best but can't match."
"On every interaction.  Literal hair pulling ensues.  Doesn't matter what goes wrong, it will still take a village of Samsung reps to fix it."
"Do the chargeback but understand Samsung may close your Samsung account for that. 

Don‚Äôt buy phones online. That doesn‚Äôt help right now, but in the future, never, ever, ever, ever buy a phone on the Internet. Never. Always pick them up in person. Carrier stores, Best Buy, the Apple Store or a Samsung store if they have such a thing, whatever you have to do. Always buy it in person. Never, ever buy a phone on the Internet. Not even brand new, not even if it‚Äôs from the manufacturer. Never.

I‚Äôve never dealt with Samsung customer service but from what I‚Äôve read in this sub, this is pretty normal."
"Hey, Yeah that‚Äôs absolutely fine. They can close my account because I feel so done with Samsung at this point. I don‚Äôt have anything on it anyway. 

But you‚Äôre right; I‚Äôm never buying a phone online again, or anything super expensive in that case from now on"
"Every phone, and most of my other tech, I've had in the past 35 years has been delivered to me, with no issues. Ordering phones online is fine, shit happens sometimes."
"That's the worse advice ever lol. Every store you mentioned will have some sorta middle man fee tagged to it. Just do your research before sending the phone in because most people come to reddit to post how someone stole their shipped phone but never come here to see what others have dealt with when returning an item to Samsung. I've bought countless phones online. I just got the S25 ultra for 860$ of Samsung website. When I returned my S23U I put a ""if seal is broken refuse package"" on it. Took pictures before and a video at the mail office. Is it too much to do? Yes. But it sure as hell is less to do if phone goes missing."
"Last 2 phones ordered online - also have never had a problem...

Sorry to hear they are putting you through the ringer."
It's your money and your time. You are allowed to do with both as you wish. :)
"I actually spoke to someone at samsung about this, and was told that this feature was removed. I used it alot, so I pushed backed and asked why. I forgot the reason (this conversation happened oven a year ago) but I will say, that if anyone else misses this feature please comment on this post. They definitely do listen to customer feedback on social media platforms"
"I think this has been a common problem with it either being hit or miss with certain phones, or just miss with certain models.  I researched this a few months ago and it wasn't clear.  I've been hoping they fix it because it doesn't work on my S25+ even though it shows the app accessing the camera."
"I just posted a thread on that today here for my S25+.  It works on the wife's S23+, which make me think they didn't just do away with it."
