# First Impressions
^in ^no ^particular ^order

Fold7: 

- The reduced thickness vs the Fold6 makes a massive difference in usability. If you can, go to a store to try it in hand, it's visually impressive but holding it makes you appreciate it on a whole other level. 
- The thinness does come with a couple of downsides:
    - It's a little difficult to open, especially with dry hands.
    - This thing is **wobbly**. Every time I set it down on a table it'll wobble for 30 seconds, and any time the table shakes even slightly it starts wobbling again. It's a little distracting if you set your phone face up next to you on your desk. 
    - Wireless charging is an exercise in frustration. The phone doesn't sit flat on pad-style chargers, and because it's basically resting on 2 points and at a severe angle, any notifications will vibrate the phone off the charger. 
- Battery is ok. Not great, you'll definitely need to top up around dinner time if you're a heavy user, but with light to medium usage it's enough to last a full day with around 5 hours SOT. 
    - I really wish they'd added a Silicon-Carbon battery though, ""just ok"" battery isn't ok at this price point on a phone marketed at power users. 
- It's nice finally having a flagship level primary camera, I don't feel like I have to give up the camera to have a foldable anymore. I wish they'd also upgraded the zoom with either a 5x zoom or a higher res 3x so we could use a lossless crop to get to 6x. 
- The cover display is more comfortable to use compared to the Fold6. It's almost the same as a regular phone, although you definitely notice that it's 21:9 when you're typing. 
- I had trouble feeling out the fingerprint scanner with the Fold6, and it's even more of an issue here. They got rid of the slight indent around the power button, so now you're just feeling out for the slight ridge from the button not being perfectly flush, or in my case feeling for the volume rocker then shifting your finger down. 
   - There's a new fingerprint registration process; you swipe your finger around on the scanner now instead of lifting between scans. It reminds me a lot of the S9/Note9 registration process, although that one was still faster since it only required a single swipe.
- The blue color is *gorgeous*. It reminds me of the Note9's blue. 
- I'm curious how the hinge will fare over time. To my hands it feels a little flimsier than the Fold6's hinge, especially when folding it shut, but we were assured by product managers that they didn't compromise on durability when designing the new hinge. Only time will tell. 
- I noticed the back getting pretty toasty next to the camera module when using the camera heavily.
- Android 16's new 90:10 split screen feature is surprisingly handy when you're juggling apps. I do wish you could do a 3-way split like you can with Oppo/OnePlus's Open Canvas feature, this is limited to 2 apps. 

Watch8 Classic:

For some context, this is my first Galaxy Watch since the original from 2018, and my first Android Wear watch since the OG Moto 360. I used a Pebble Time Round between the Moto and the Galaxy Watch, then switched to an Apple Watch that's been my primary since. 

- I love the rotating bezel. It's so satisfying to use to scroll around menus. The physical click is nicer than the simulated clicks from the Apple Watch's crown, although I‚Äôve noticed that the Apple Watch's crown is a little more consistent. I didn't realize how much I missed it from my old Galaxy Watch.
- Design is a mixed bag for me. 
    - I like the materials used; it definitely looks classy enough to dress up without looking too out of place with a casual outfit. 
    - I don't like that they brought over the ""circle in a square"" design from last year's Ultra. It is more rounded than that design, which I appreciate, but I think the fully circular designs they've used up to the Watch7 were much nicer. 
    - Small detail, but the black plastic piece around the buttons looks very out of place on a watch like this. 
- I have smaller wrists, so I was worried about the size, but it fits ok. I'd definitely go for a smaller one if it was available though, it's straddling the line for me. 
- I got around 30 hours on a charge with most settings left at their defaults (AOD and automatic workout/sleep detection on being the two biggest things). About the same as my AW10. 
    - Still have to charge daily, but the biggest thing for me is that it can make it a full day and still have enough charge for sleep tracking without having to top up before bed. 
- I'm not a fan of the new Dynamic Lug system, for two reasons:
    - I liked that previous Galaxy Watches could use standard watch bands. I don't think the switch to a proprietary connector is worth the (marginal, IMO) improvement to fit.
    - I've had a really hard time pressing the button to release the band. Tried with my unit and multiple demo units at Unpacked, had it demoed to me by two different people, and I still have trouble pressing the button down enough to release the band. I keep my fingernails pretty short, so I think that's the issue.

1mtyiqg,"A month in with the Z Flip7, I gotta say man... sigh... I love this phone, but it's a little disappointing","Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.

For one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.

At least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.

The cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).

I'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.

Along with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go.

Titanium has vastly higher tensile strength than aluminum alloys, so its omission is surprising.\n\nThe camera system is mostly on par with the S25 Ultra, but it‚Äôs missing the periscope telephoto lens the only other lens I actually care about. The ultra wide can be dropped for all it‚Äôs worth.\n\nBattery life is still mediocre. Silicon carbide batteries have been in the works and would realistically provide about 50% more life at the same thickness. The only reason I can imagine this wasn‚Äôt implemented is to hold it back as the Z Fold 8‚Äôs main selling point planned obsolescence at work.\n\nFinally, dropping S Pen functionality is just strange. A larger inner canvas would only benefit from stylus support. Even if there‚Äôs no space to store one internally, compatibility should have been preserved.\n\nThe most amount of money buys you a curiosity that is visually stunning but still paired back and contains flaws that muddle the experience. I‚Äôd rather stick with my bar smartphone that is boring but has the best of everything Samsung can currently offer. At this rate I‚Äôm sure by Z fold 10 or 11 they will be spec wise identical to the ultra phone, only thing there is hoping they finally move to solid willow glass.', 'comment_score': 0, 'comment_created_utc': 1755566693.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9ixv2z', 'parent_id': 't1_n9gy2jj', 'comment_text': 'Reading this makes me feel old.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755610044.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9k48gv', 'parent_id': 't1_n9jxjbr', 'comment_text': 'I do, so much so it makes me picky in what I expect im a third category of device to move me from my current setup.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755622391.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9fk3tj', 'parent_id': 't1_n9fg9ic', 'comment_text': ""Maybe for some people.

Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.\n\n>It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.\n\n>But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it‚Äôs all about the screen.\n\n>In the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple‚Äôs market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.\n\n>Apple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It‚Äôs often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.\n\n>That‚Äôs one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung‚Äôs stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.\n\n>Apple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.\n\n>In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung‚Äôs catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge. \n\n>The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.\n\n>One user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.\n\n>In the past month, Samsung‚Äôs premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.\n\n>The market share numbers aren‚Äôt just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.\n\n>But Samsung‚Äôs gains also reflect the company‚Äôs ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung‚Äôs second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.\n\n>Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy and Z phone lineup ‚Äústretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,‚Äù said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. ‚ÄúThere is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.‚Äù\n\n>Samsung‚Äôs first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers ‚Äî including CNBC ‚Äî discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.\n\n>But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.\n\n>‚ÄúThere really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,‚Äù said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.\n\n>The South Korean company doesn‚Äôt provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device‚Äôs predecessor by nearly 50%.\n\n>‚ÄúSamsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,‚Äù said Bjorhovde. ‚ÄùTry to be ahead, show that something is different, and there‚Äôs a certain halo effect from that.‚Äù\n\n>According to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung‚Äôs sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a ‚Äúslight boost‚Äù from the slim S25 Edge.\n\n>Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google‚Äôs Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can‚Äôt get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n\n>Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google‚Äôs circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they‚Äôd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.\n\n>On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.', 'comment_score': 24, 'comment_created_utc': 1755476401.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9aj8y7', 'parent_id': 't3_1mt2pwi', 'comment_text': 'I know that high level staff are sometimes choosing folding samsung phones instead of a new iphone -- because when I give them the option they are choosing the samsung.', 'comment_score': 20, 'comment_created_utc': 1755488947.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9av15w', 'parent_id': 't3_1mt2pwi', 'comment_text': 'iPhone just feels the same ole.  \n\nVery tempted to get the z fold 7.', 'comment_score': 12, 'comment_created_utc': 1755494787.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9c0npn', 'parent_id': 't3_1mt2pwi', 'comment_text': ""Good.

1mtqvqy,Buds 3 pro experiences,"I was wondering how everyones experience with the buds 3 are.

Mine so far:
- General quality is good, they fit nicely when using the correct tip sizes.
- Noise cancelling inside the home is decent.
- Noise cancelling outside in windy weather is just absolute garbage, my Buds2 Pro were superior in every way
- Noise Cancelling adjustment feels useless, no noticable effect
- Evironment sound when enabled is boosted way to much, would be nice to have a volume setting for it
- Dropped one of the tips on a wooden table from approx 25cm height, and all im hearing from that now is a nice bit of static with some beeping (my fault, bud damn, they're fragile?!)

Since one of mine broke anyway im considering going back to buds2, i wonder about the durability in the buds3 now.

It just works better than my S24.  \nIt is thinner, Smaller, lighter and better shaped for the hand.  \nThe display is sharper ( higher PPI - and I find it has less black crush)\n\nIn my testing around my house, at car and motorcycle shows, snapping moving objects, the S10e is over all more sharp with better edge definition and contrast in its images. The S24 is soft, and washed out by comparison. The s10e while often over saturated, still gets the over all color feel of a scene closer to reality than the washed out photos the S24 takes. This is not even Hyperbole : look up the test photos on GSM arena. In good lighting the S10e is WAY sharper...and in low lighting is nearly as good as the 5 year newer phone.\n\nThe OS is hands down better : I actually find that many apps are MORE responsive on my S10e, than on the much newer more powerful S24...One UI7 was a disaster for me and removed many features I consider requirements ( such as non grouped notifications...) Heck, even android auto is more responsive when using my S10e. I have never been so disappointed with a phone before as I am with the S24.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9o2ptcinzajf1.jpeg?width=1922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=083142b9e28e4f2ec2190337e54b3cd9e321cdbf', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316461.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8ybwxa', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'I owned Galaxy S10 from 2019-2025 and it didnt have a scratch on it and was still able to sell it for 50‚Ç¨‚Ä¶ shame it stopped getting updates around 2023 and the battery life was pretty bad‚Ä¶ now I have switched to Iphone and am confused as hell, but battery life is amazing on 16 Pro, I charge it every 2 days, but on Samsung that is immpossible', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316601.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8ybwxp', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'The Galaxy S8 was my first big boy/most reliable phone ever yo', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316601.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8yc7bh', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'Note 7', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316730.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8ygekm', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'M31s  still perfectly works after 5 years.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755318688.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8yhonn', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'All of them', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755319318.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8yhyeb', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': ""Honestly all the S line since Galaxy i9000/original S1 I've used have been extremely reliable.

More specifically, these Samsung premium phones are equipped with a special edition ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.\n\n>What's interesting is that, thanks to the Galaxy S25 series, Qualcomm sold more than 20 million Snapdragon 8 Elite ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù chips, making this version more popular than the standard one.\n\n>Reportedly, the combined sales of the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which other Android OEMs used for their premium phones, were lower than 20 million.\n\n>In other words, not only does this show that Samsung's exclusive Elite version is by far the most popular in the world, but it also means that the Galaxy S25 series alone outsold all of its other Android competitors combined ‚Äî at least those who used the standard version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in their phones.\n\n>Samsung is Qualcomm's most profitable smartphone partner, judging by sales. Ironically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, which Qualcomm and Samsung co-developed, is more popular than the base version developed solely by Qualcomm.\n\n>The chip version exclusive to Samsung has the main CPU cores clocked at a higher frequency of 4.47GHz, up from the standard version's 4.32GHz.\n\n>The source also mentions that the same story will likely repeat next year with the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2.

1mp4l62,First Day with Bespoke All In 1 Washer,"Love this! I‚Äôm a working mom in tech (crazy hours) and also a military veteran with back issues. I didn‚Äôt realize how convenient this machine might be when I bought this (costco deal!) I‚Äôll def check in later in a couple months with quirks. If you‚Äôre an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!

1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. 
2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. 
3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. 
4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don‚Äôt have to do that anymore. 
5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.

Quirks
- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it‚Äôs probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that‚Äôs what killed the other dryer. 
- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging 
- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. 

Recommendations (grain of salt cause I haven‚Äôt had enough time to fool with the UI)
- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I‚Äôm going to start to train to load and start.

1ml3z7s,Ease of Switch From iPhone to Samsung?,"As the title says, I‚Äôm concerned about the ease of ‚Äúthe big switch‚Äù. I had issues many years ago so I am worried. I would be switching from a iPhone 15 to a Galaxy Z Flip 7.


My first phone was an iPhone 5C, and the next was a Samsung Galaxy (don‚Äôt remember what gen), and the switch was very annoying. I had issues with not receiving random messages that somehow got sent only to iMessage, literally like in the middle of the conversation I would miss a message and we eventually found out that was what‚Äôs happening. We ended up fixing it after a couple years, we had to talk to apple support and it got fixed but it was a huge confusing experience. Switching back to apple years later was seamless.


Most of the questions I see about switching are about being concerned about not having iMessage, or losing functionality with other apple devices. I‚Äôm not concerned about this. I originally switched back to iPhone for the ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù as I was in high school, but truly I don‚Äôt feel there is anything I would miss about iPhone at this point.

1mbkyfm,First-time user of Samsung,"Hello,

I recently bought a Galaxy S24+ and it's my first experience with the brand, I've always used Motorola phones (which I am a huge enthusiast, but got upset with my last phone so I decided to take a look at other brands).

I must say I'm having a hard time with this guy, it's a very nice device, beautiful and smooth, but sometimes I can't find simple things on it, I have to scroll all over the phone and search it online hahaha it's kinda different from Hello UI, but I'm enjoying the experience with One UI.

So I'm here to ask, as a first-time user: what should I know about the brand/interface? And what do you guys like the most about your device?

1mb6kvk,Z Fold 7 Rant.,"I feel like the Z Fold 7's lack of S Pen support has been deliberately swept under the rug.

I stupidly preordered the 7 because of this, blissfully unaware.

After all, I've been a Z Fold user since the 3. Why, 7 generations deep, would we randomly stop having access to one of the best features of this type of phone?

I no longer really understand what this phone is *for* now, or who the target demographic is.

I've never had to return a phone within the 2 week cooking off period before but there's a first for everything üòÇ

I don't even know why I'm posting this, I just think this choice was utterly insane.

Now that it's back, I'm actually happy to be on the newest watch.

Now I previously never upgraded my smartwatch, because it's nowhere near the difference you get with upgrading a phone, and I've been stuck on the original Galaxy Watch because I love Tizen and didn't want to go to Wear OS, but Samsung kinda pushed me from that after discontinuing things and my biggest problem with Wear OS is that it was never fluid like Tizen was. I think they finally nailed that, especially with animations. My Watch6 Classic animations were laggy at times, and I don't see that with the 8.

The only things I see wrong so far is that you can't reverse wireless charge with it anymore, and even though the new watch bands are NICE... they're not universal.

1m8fr6z,How much battery have you lost over the year(s)?,"My Galaxy Note 9 has 50% degradation haha. (It doesn't have a battery protection feature so I'm not sure if that is why.) Same with my old iPhone.  
  
My daily driver Fold3 has always been set to 80% maximum charge (Settings->Battery->Battery Protection->Maximum Protection). The new battery capacity is 4400 mAh, the current capacity after 4 years of daily driving is 4275 mAh. It's about 3% of capacity loss. Just from my experience using it, I can't detect any capacity loss and the battery lasts around 2-3 days.

I'm curious what others are seeing and what to expect longer-term. I'll probably upgrade soon to the Fold7 but a lot of people (nephews, parents, cousins) want the hand-me-down Folds. It's still surprisingly rare to see one and they are fascinated by it.

1m7zl9b,Opinions of a long-time Samsung user,"I've been a long-time Samsung fan (my first Samsung was the S3, and I've stuck with the brand ever since). I own the full ecosystem, including a PC and wearable devices, and overall I've been happy with the experience.

That said, over the past few years, I‚Äôve felt the quality steadily decline. My S22 (bought in 2023) started overheating and having battery issues after just a year, and eventually became unusable ‚Äî the camera stopped working and the battery wouldn‚Äôt even last me through a day at university. So, I decided to switch to the S24, but now, a year later, I‚Äôm starting to see the same issues again: it overheats and the battery life keeps getting worse‚Ä¶

This brand is starting to feel less and less reliable to me with each passing year. I just want a phone that can last a few years, but even their flagship models don't seem to make it past two anymore.
The quality keeps going downhill, and I‚Äôm seriously thinking of moving away from Samsung soon.

1m4fsq2,From iSheep to Sam Fam,"Purchased S24U, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Galaxy Watch 7 last week. Switched from Apple Ecosystem to this.  Still use an iPad and a Mac but my iPhone 16 was to restricted. Was in the 'walled garden' for 3 years but after some time the Apple ecosystem features felt overrated. Using an iPhone when I could get my hands on the beast called S24 Ultra was too much for my gentle heart to bear. Don't even miss my Airpods and Apple Watch.

In my opinion, health tracking is better on Samsung since a unified view of all parameters is provided on Samsung Health app whereas on iPhone such parameters were scattered between Apple Health and Fitness App.

Sound quality is better on Galaxy Buds 3 pro though ANC is 8/10 on a scale where airpods prob2 anc would be 9/10.

Apart from the usual freedom that Android provides, Galaxy AI was a huge selling point. AI tools in Gallery are unparalleled compared to any such AI integration in the industry especially Apple.

I was quoted INR 1,600 (USD 20), and after a long argument with Samsung reps, they reduced it to INR 600 (USD 7).\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nIf you‚Äôre considering the Galaxy Z Flip 7, only buy it if you‚Äôre fully prepared to baby the phone.\nIt‚Äôs a premium product with a unique form factor, but the joy of the compact design fades quickly when you start worrying about screen bubbles, hinge falls, and pricey repairs.\n\nI personally regret getting the Flip and would‚Äôve been much happier with a Galaxy S24 or even waiting for the S25. The Flip Phones are great for style, but not for peace of mind in my opinion.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1752918089.0}, {'comment_id': 'n3s2ypx', 'parent_id': 't3_1m27l9v', 'comment_text': 'It‚Äôs will last until an update bricks it a couple months after warranty ends.

1m0f6iw,"Samsung could dominate foldables today ‚Äî they‚Äôre just choosing not to (CSC network band limitations, tiny batteries hinder longevity after charge cycles degradation)","Samsung has the best displays, multitasking UI, build quality, and the most efficient chipset ‚Äì Snapdragon 8 Elite. They're this close to making the perfect foldable.

But year after year, they **hold back**:

- Still using a **tiny 4400 mAh battery** (unchanged for 4+ generations)  (aside from shorter daily runtime on a charge, the smaller battery is going to degrade much faster, requiring a replacement sooner)
- **Slow charging** compared to rivals  
- **CSC-based network band restrictions** that cripple global use  
  - e.g. US and Canada models used internationally can‚Äôt access hardware-supported bands without [unlocking](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-enable-all-bands-through-service-menu-on-us-ca-s23-series-including-sub-6-and-mmwave.4554611/), which they [took away on the S25](https://www.reddit.com/r/cellmapper/comments/1ie9qo1/s25_ultra_on_verizon_service_mode_menu_locked/) and [subsequently brought back in a beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/cellmapper/comments/1kxzfrp/oneui_8_beta_on_the_s25_ultra_appears_to_fix_73/) that may or may not last  
  - Even then, **Carrier Aggregation is crippled** globally, so LTE and 5G throughput takes a hit  
  - Importing a global model won't solve this either ‚Äî you'll just have the opposite problem: good performance outside the US and Canada, **poor compatibility inside** them

Meanwhile, Chinese brands are shipping **5800+ mAh batteries** and **faster charging** in similar packages, proving it *can* be done.

And while Google‚Äôs Pixel 9 Pro Fold has better network support (even more bands than the iPhone 16 Pro Max) and longer software updates, it lacks Samsung‚Äôs polish and multitasking features. Plus, it‚Äôs thicker and heavier (257g vs Samsung‚Äôs 215g).

Samsung could fix most of this **tomorrow** ‚Äî bigger battery, unlock bands, polish multitasking ‚Äî but they won‚Äôt.

Because they‚Äôre still selling these at $2,000 a pop.  
They‚Äôre comfortable. Too comfortable.

---

Until us users push harder, they‚Äôll keep drip-feeding us ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù and calling it innovation.

Unfortunately, we realistically only have two options in the US and Canada: Samsung's Folds and Google's Folds. The Chinese brands omit support for US and Canada network bands and have even more software issues that make them a dealbreaker for many of us.

Hopefully, Samsung employees are reading this and taking this feedback seriously.",rayw_reddit,18,23,1752578607.0,"[{'comment_id': 'n3cs1o9', 'parent_id': 't3_1m0f6iw', 'comment_text': 'people still continue to buy them this subreddit everyone seemed eager to pre order it and pay only ""700"" for the phone acting like their zfold 6 was free or somthing lol', 'comment_score': 23, 'comment_created_utc': 1752622433.0}, {'comment_id': 'n3cuex9', 'parent_id': 't3_1m0f6iw', 'comment_text': 'Drip feeding innovation is lack of market competition.

1lxf4qe,One UI 8 and possibly improved image processing?,"Has anyone tried capturing moving subjects (kids, pets) with the latest One UI 8 betas?

I read somewhere that there's supposed to be a new and/or improved version of the image processor that might be able to do a better job combining multiple frames?

Samsung phones take really nice photos until someone moves... Would be nice to see some improvements in that area. In my tests, the biggest difference between Samsung and Google is that Pixels will quickly switch to a faster shutter speed if they detect something moving.

Anyway, I'll test myself when the Z Fold 7 arrives, but was curious if anyone's tried it on existing hardware already.

No, but they liked the aesthetic of one, so they get the closest thing to that, which is the S line. This continues throughout the ultra line, and with the foldables.

Being able to simply hold home and then select some text (that may not be selectable otherwise) or tap an image to quickly research text or an image in a pop-up window, without having to (manually) open a new tab/app to search in is frequently very convenient. Being able to do similar such stuff with ""Smart Select"" using my S-pen is also quite handy other times. As someone that frequently browses browses/views content in other languages (despite only knowing English well), I\'m also a huge fan of the ability to quickly translate stuff in any language to English on this phone, be it by translating the entire screen at any given moment with Circle to Search or by translating text I point the S-pen at with the Air Command menu\'s Translate option.\n\nHaving said all that, the translation functionality is not as simple, fluid, and universal as I imagine it theoretically could be. With Circle to Search, I need to repeatedly hold home and tap translate every time I reach a new screen or see new text. With the S-pen translation, I need to keep pointing at every little bit of foreign text I want to understand. Many browser applications already allow you to automatically translate pages in foreign languages to your own language, but it\'d be nice if this functionality was available at a system level, so foreign languages across any app could automatically be translated into your language.\n\nBasic level would just be automatically translating selectable text, but it\'d be extra nice if they could also translate text in images and maybe even translate audio (when Live Captions are active). That way, I could say, watch a Japanese-speaking livestreamer in an app like Youtube or Twitch and at least understand what their primarily Japanese-speaking viewers are saying in their chat, plus possibly understand the streamer. Samsung already has AI functionality to translate calls, texts, and spoken conversations, so it\'d be nice if this could just be a more universal and automatic thing.\n\nAlso, on another note, I log all my meals in Samsung Health and regularly wind up having to add custom foods because the FatSecret database is hardly all-encompassing. However it\'s a huge hassle to have to enter the food name and up to 15 different nutrient values for every custom food... especially when the order of nutrients on labels isn\'t too consistent. Would be amazing if there was a function (through AI or otherwise) that let me point my phone camera at a nutritional label to extract the nutrient numbers and populate them in a custom food. Even better if it can analyze an image/table with nutritional details for several items at some (fast) food place and automatically pull the relevant numbers for the item name you specify (cause good god it\'s an ordeal with some of those nutrition sheets when they have dozens of rows/columns in a static PDF/image).', 'comment_score': 2, 'comment_created_utc': 1752085192.0}, {'comment_id': 'n3euug5', 'parent_id': 't3_1lupezw', 'comment_text': ""I just want a button that turns it all off.

1lrevy8,How Samsung's management' decision push loyal customers away,"Top management's incompetence has ruined many great companies.

So, I was choosing between Samsung's and Huawei's top earbuds for calls, and while most youtubers say FreeBuds Pro 4 are slightly better in terms of call quality, I decided to give Samsung Buds Pro 3 a chance, because I have been using my Note 20 ultra for years, and I like it. Until...

Until I found out that some utterly incompetent manager decided to make it impossible to have multipoint with non-Samsung devices.

What were they even thinking? Do they really expect us to ditch our expensive laptops for some Samsung product just to have multipoint with their earbuds?

Result: I am not buying the Samsung product. Now there is a chance I will get acquainted with a direct competitor's ecosystem.

1lpvjwi,Diabolical customer service,"Has anyone else experienced this diabolical customer service from Samsung? 

I received aGalaxy S25 and Galaxy Buds Pro3 on the 3rd of June, I wasn‚Äôt happy with it so I retuned it on the 6th of June. 

Passed from online rep to online rep only to be passed back to the original online rep who originally couldn‚Äôt do the return for me but then finally did the return and told me I‚Äôll have a full refund in 14 days. 

DPD lost the parcel at their sorting facility (obviously stolen). 

I chased Samsung and they told me I have to deal with DPD myself even though I‚Äôve tried contacting DPD and I can‚Äôt get through to anyone. 

So I reached out to Samsung again, they‚Äôve escalated it so they can investigate why it‚Äôs taking so long. 

I then get an email asking me for the tacking number of the return they generated for me. 

A few days later, I receive an email saying they‚Äôre gonna exchange the phone for me, with no mention of the Galaxy buds EVEN THOUGH I REQUESTED A REFUND NOT AN EXCHANGE. 

I‚Äôve emailed Samsung again asking why they‚Äôve done this. No reply. I‚Äôve now sent them another email expressing how angry I am and wanting to raise a complaint. 

I‚Äôve spoken with my credit card provider and they‚Äôre doing a chargeback thing for me.
