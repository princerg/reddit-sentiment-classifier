# First Impressions
^in ^no ^particular ^order

Fold7: 

- The reduced thickness vs the Fold6 makes a massive difference in usability. If you can, go to a store to try it in hand, it's visually impressive but holding it makes you appreciate it on a whole other level. 
- The thinness does come with a couple of downsides:
    - It's a little difficult to open, especially with dry hands.
    - This thing is **wobbly**. Every time I set it down on a table it'll wobble for 30 seconds, and any time the table shakes even slightly it starts wobbling again. It's a little distracting if you set your phone face up next to you on your desk. 
    - Wireless charging is an exercise in frustration. The phone doesn't sit flat on pad-style chargers, and because it's basically resting on 2 points and at a severe angle, any notifications will vibrate the phone off the charger. 
- Battery is ok. Not great, you'll definitely need to top up around dinner time if you're a heavy user, but with light to medium usage it's enough to last a full day with around 5 hours SOT. 
    - I really wish they'd added a Silicon-Carbon battery though, ""just ok"" battery isn't ok at this price point on a phone marketed at power users. 
- It's nice finally having a flagship level primary camera, I don't feel like I have to give up the camera to have a foldable anymore. I wish they'd also upgraded the zoom with either a 5x zoom or a higher res 3x so we could use a lossless crop to get to 6x. 
- The cover display is more comfortable to use compared to the Fold6. It's almost the same as a regular phone, although you definitely notice that it's 21:9 when you're typing. 
- I had trouble feeling out the fingerprint scanner with the Fold6, and it's even more of an issue here. They got rid of the slight indent around the power button, so now you're just feeling out for the slight ridge from the button not being perfectly flush, or in my case feeling for the volume rocker then shifting your finger down. 
   - There's a new fingerprint registration process; you swipe your finger around on the scanner now instead of lifting between scans. It reminds me a lot of the S9/Note9 registration process, although that one was still faster since it only required a single swipe.
- The blue color is *gorgeous*. It reminds me of the Note9's blue. 
- I'm curious how the hinge will fare over time. To my hands it feels a little flimsier than the Fold6's hinge, especially when folding it shut, but we were assured by product managers that they didn't compromise on durability when designing the new hinge. Only time will tell. 
- I noticed the back getting pretty toasty next to the camera module when using the camera heavily.
- Android 16's new 90:10 split screen feature is surprisingly handy when you're juggling apps. I do wish you could do a 3-way split like you can with Oppo/OnePlus's Open Canvas feature, this is limited to 2 apps. 

Watch8 Classic:

For some context, this is my first Galaxy Watch since the original from 2018, and my first Android Wear watch since the OG Moto 360. I used a Pebble Time Round between the Moto and the Galaxy Watch, then switched to an Apple Watch that's been my primary since. 

- I love the rotating bezel. It's so satisfying to use to scroll around menus. The physical click is nicer than the simulated clicks from the Apple Watch's crown, although I’ve noticed that the Apple Watch's crown is a little more consistent. I didn't realize how much I missed it from my old Galaxy Watch.
- Design is a mixed bag for me. 
    - I like the materials used; it definitely looks classy enough to dress up without looking too out of place with a casual outfit. 
    - I don't like that they brought over the ""circle in a square"" design from last year's Ultra. It is more rounded than that design, which I appreciate, but I think the fully circular designs they've used up to the Watch7 were much nicer. 
    - Small detail, but the black plastic piece around the buttons looks very out of place on a watch like this. 
- I have smaller wrists, so I was worried about the size, but it fits ok. I'd definitely go for a smaller one if it was available though, it's straddling the line for me. 
- I got around 30 hours on a charge with most settings left at their defaults (AOD and automatic workout/sleep detection on being the two biggest things). About the same as my AW10. 
    - Still have to charge daily, but the biggest thing for me is that it can make it a full day and still have enough charge for sleep tracking without having to top up before bed. 
- I'm not a fan of the new Dynamic Lug system, for two reasons:
    - I liked that previous Galaxy Watches could use standard watch bands. I don't think the switch to a proprietary connector is worth the (marginal, IMO) improvement to fit.
    - I've had a really hard time pressing the button to release the band. Tried with my unit and multiple demo units at Unpacked, had it demoed to me by two different people, and I still have trouble pressing the button down enough to release the band. I keep my fingernails pretty short, so I think that's the issue.

1mtyiqg,"A month in with the Z Flip7, I gotta say man... sigh... I love this phone, but it's a little disappointing","Samsung did a lot of good with this phone. Like a lot. They made the cover screen a lot better than what it used to be, and I can do and see a lot more because of that. They improved the durability with it, they refined the feel and look of it, the crease seems to of gotten a lot better, it has the latest One UI 8 outside the box, it's a snappy phone, it's loud... like Samsung did a lot of good with it. But I have my issues too.

For one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.

At least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.

The cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).

I'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.

Along with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go.

Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.\n\n>It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.\n\n>But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it’s all about the screen.\n\n>In the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple’s market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.\n\n>Apple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It’s often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.\n\n>That’s one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung’s stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.\n\n>Apple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.\n\n>In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung’s catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge. \n\n>The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.\n\n>One user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.\n\n>In the past month, Samsung’s premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.\n\n>The market share numbers aren’t just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing “disruption” in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.\n\n>But Samsung’s gains also reflect the company’s ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung’s second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.\n\n>Samsung’s Galaxy and Z phone lineup “stretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,” said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. “There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.”\n\n>Samsung’s first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers — including CNBC — discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.\n\n>But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.\n\n>“There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,” said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.\n\n>The South Korean company doesn’t provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device’s predecessor by nearly 50%.\n\n>“Samsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,” said Bjorhovde. ”Try to be ahead, show that something is different, and there’s a certain halo effect from that.”\n\n>According to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung’s sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a “slight boost” from the slim S25 Edge.\n\n>Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google’s Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can’t get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n\n>Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google’s circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they’d like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.\n\n>On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.', 'comment_score': 24, 'comment_created_utc': 1755476401.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9aj8y7', 'parent_id': 't3_1mt2pwi', 'comment_text': 'I know that high level staff are sometimes choosing folding samsung phones instead of a new iphone -- because when I give them the option they are choosing the samsung.', 'comment_score': 20, 'comment_created_utc': 1755488947.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9av15w', 'parent_id': 't3_1mt2pwi', 'comment_text': 'iPhone just feels the same ole.  \n\nVery tempted to get the z fold 7.', 'comment_score': 12, 'comment_created_utc': 1755494787.0}, {'comment_id': 'n9c0npn', 'parent_id': 't3_1mt2pwi', 'comment_text': ""Good.

1mtqvqy,Buds 3 pro experiences,"I was wondering how everyones experience with the buds 3 are.

Mine so far:
- General quality is good, they fit nicely when using the correct tip sizes.
- Noise cancelling inside the home is decent.
- Noise cancelling outside in windy weather is just absolute garbage, my Buds2 Pro were superior in every way
- Noise Cancelling adjustment feels useless, no noticable effect
- Evironment sound when enabled is boosted way to much, would be nice to have a volume setting for it
- Dropped one of the tips on a wooden table from approx 25cm height, and all im hearing from that now is a nice bit of static with some beeping (my fault, bud damn, they're fragile?!)

Since one of mine broke anyway im considering going back to buds2, i wonder about the durability in the buds3 now.

It just works better than my S24.  \nIt is thinner, Smaller, lighter and better shaped for the hand.  \nThe display is sharper ( higher PPI - and I find it has less black crush)\n\nIn my testing around my house, at car and motorcycle shows, snapping moving objects, the S10e is over all more sharp with better edge definition and contrast in its images. The S24 is soft, and washed out by comparison. The s10e while often over saturated, still gets the over all color feel of a scene closer to reality than the washed out photos the S24 takes. This is not even Hyperbole : look up the test photos on GSM arena. In good lighting the S10e is WAY sharper...and in low lighting is nearly as good as the 5 year newer phone.\n\nThe OS is hands down better : I actually find that many apps are MORE responsive on my S10e, than on the much newer more powerful S24...One UI7 was a disaster for me and removed many features I consider requirements ( such as non grouped notifications...) Heck, even android auto is more responsive when using my S10e. I have never been so disappointed with a phone before as I am with the S24.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9o2ptcinzajf1.jpeg?width=1922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=083142b9e28e4f2ec2190337e54b3cd9e321cdbf', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316461.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8ybwxa', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'I owned Galaxy S10 from 2019-2025 and it didnt have a scratch on it and was still able to sell it for 50€… shame it stopped getting updates around 2023 and the battery life was pretty bad… now I have switched to Iphone and am confused as hell, but battery life is amazing on 16 Pro, I charge it every 2 days, but on Samsung that is immpossible', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316601.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8ybwxp', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'The Galaxy S8 was my first big boy/most reliable phone ever yo', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316601.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8yc7bh', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'Note 7', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755316730.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8ygekm', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'M31s  still perfectly works after 5 years.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755318688.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8yhonn', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': 'All of them', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1755319318.0}, {'comment_id': 'n8yhyeb', 'parent_id': 't3_1mqy1k4', 'comment_text': ""Honestly all the S line since Galaxy i9000/original S1 I've used have been extremely reliable.

Leaker @UniverseIce shared some fun facts that shed some light on Samsung's performance compared to its Android rivals.\n\n>The Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra exclusively use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip globally. More specifically, these Samsung premium phones are equipped with a special edition “for Galaxy” Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.\n\n>What's interesting is that, thanks to the Galaxy S25 series, Qualcomm sold more than 20 million Snapdragon 8 Elite “for Galaxy” chips, making this version more popular than the standard one.\n\n>Reportedly, the combined sales of the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which other Android OEMs used for their premium phones, were lower than 20 million.\n\n>In other words, not only does this show that Samsung's exclusive Elite version is by far the most popular in the world, but it also means that the Galaxy S25 series alone outsold all of its other Android competitors combined — at least those who used the standard version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in their phones.\n\n>Samsung is Qualcomm's most profitable smartphone partner, judging by sales. Ironically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, which Qualcomm and Samsung co-developed, is more popular than the base version developed solely by Qualcomm.\n\n>The chip version exclusive to Samsung has the main CPU cores clocked at a higher frequency of 4.47GHz, up from the standard version's 4.32GHz.\n\n>The source also mentions that the same story will likely repeat next year with the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2.

1mp4l62,First Day with Bespoke All In 1 Washer,"Love this! I’m a working mom in tech (crazy hours) and also a military veteran with back issues. I didn’t realize how convenient this machine might be when I bought this (costco deal!) I’ll def check in later in a couple months with quirks. If you’re an engineer that worked on this product - thank you!

1. Loads a bunch of wash fluids (detergent & such). Back saver. 
2. I just set and forget. Literally can get a load done overnight!! Currently folding overnights load and drinking coffee. 
3. AI wash and dry. So far so good! Clothes feel and smell amazing. Used tap cold. 
4. The moving of loads between washer dryer was my least favorite part, not out of laziness, (well sometimes) but out of literal pain and lack of time with my schedule. I don’t have to do that anymore. 
5. Very quiet. Like oddly quiet.

Quirks
- the lint collector is a little overkill (seems over engineered) but I figured it out. And it’s probably cause I have the ventless. Not mad cause I hate the venting route in my rental. Pretty sure that’s what killed the other dryer. 
- size/weight might be a turn-off if you like to clean behind/under your unit quarterly. 300lbs is not budging 
- there are a lot of settings. AI wash is great and not going to fool with anything else. 

Recommendations (grain of salt cause I haven’t had enough time to fool with the UI)
- a simple UI setting. I worry when I try to teach my parents when they visit that 1. The font is too small and 2. They will get overwhelmed. I would like to have a simple play button (which would do AI wash) for my parents and my young daughter who I’m going to start to train to load and start.

1ml3z7s,Ease of Switch From iPhone to Samsung?,"As the title says, I’m concerned about the ease of “the big switch”. I had issues many years ago so I am worried. I would be switching from a iPhone 15 to a Galaxy Z Flip 7.


My first phone was an iPhone 5C, and the next was a Samsung Galaxy (don’t remember what gen), and the switch was very annoying. I had issues with not receiving random messages that somehow got sent only to iMessage, literally like in the middle of the conversation I would miss a message and we eventually found out that was what’s happening. We ended up fixing it after a couple years, we had to talk to apple support and it got fixed but it was a huge confusing experience. Switching back to apple years later was seamless.


Most of the questions I see about switching are about being concerned about not having iMessage, or losing functionality with other apple devices. I’m not concerned about this. I originally switched back to iPhone for the “cool factor” as I was in high school, but truly I don’t feel there is anything I would miss about iPhone at this point. I just want to know if any of you have had issues recently with switching.

If your usage revolves around Apple Music and little else, the transition is straightforward: the primary inconvenience is repurchasing apps you previously bought on iOS, as most apps need to be purchased again for Android.\n\nHowever, if you rely heavily on Apple exclusive apps like Pages, Keynote, or strictly Apple’s iCloud services without integrating Google services, which is increasingly rare even among the most loyal Apple users the process becomes more frustrating. Converting or exporting existing work, syncing documents, and maintaining continuity across devices can be a significant headache.\n\nFor my own setup, I’ve been a Galaxy S phone user and iPad Pro user for over six years. Apple Music works seamlessly across platforms, making the audio transition effortless. Apple Photos, synced with Google Photos, ensures that even the rare times I snap a photo on my iPad, it’s instantly available on my phone without extra steps. In other words, thoughtful cross platform use of services can dramatically smooth the transition from iOS to Android.\n\nColleagues often ask me, “Why not just use an iPhone so you don’t have to deal with all that manual setup?” The truth is, iOS and iPadOS are essentially the same ecosystem. iPadOS only recently got its own name, and even then, the differences from iOS are mostly limited to features like Split View and the dock for multitasking. Beyond that, it’s largely a carbon copy of the iPhone interface.\n\ndon’t want two identical devices. If I were going to use an iPad the same way as an iPhone, I might as well find a workaround to make calls on the iPad too but that defeats the point. I prefer keeping devices distinct in purpose and experience, rather than duplicating functionality across hardware.\n\niPad pro is my media consumption device when I want a larger screen, yes large video with minimal letter boxing unlike the galaxy fold which is a horrible 3.75:3 aspect ratio ( nearly square ) which makes video content negligibly large than the S25 ultra.

1mbkyfm,First-time user of Samsung,"Hello,

I recently bought a Galaxy S24+ and it's my first experience with the brand, I've always used Motorola phones (which I am a huge enthusiast, but got upset with my last phone so I decided to take a look at other brands).

I must say I'm having a hard time with this guy, it's a very nice device, beautiful and smooth, but sometimes I can't find simple things on it, I have to scroll all over the phone and search it online hahaha it's kinda different from Hello UI, but I'm enjoying the experience with One UI.

So I'm here to ask, as a first-time user: what should I know about the brand/interface? And what do you guys like the most about your device?

1mb6kvk,Z Fold 7 Rant.,"I feel like the Z Fold 7's lack of S Pen support has been deliberately swept under the rug.

I stupidly preordered the 7 because of this, blissfully unaware.

After all, I've been a Z Fold user since the 3. Why, 7 generations deep, would we randomly stop having access to one of the best features of this type of phone?

I no longer really understand what this phone is *for* now, or who the target demographic is.

I've never had to return a phone within the 2 week cooking off period before but there's a first for everything 😂

I don't even know why I'm posting this, I just think this choice was utterly insane.


So uhhh. While I'm here...Are there any other recommended foldables with Wacom digitisers or am I stuck on my Z Fold 6 until Samsung hopefully sees sense next year with the Z Fold 8? 🫠",Naylaaaaa,28,114,1753676037.0,"[{'comment_id': 'n5oin0l', 'parent_id': 't3_1mb6kvk', 'comment_text': 'It was pointed out in EVERY YouTube video...', 'comment_score': 100, 'comment_created_utc': 1753737294.0}, {'comment_id': 'n5neoyc', 'parent_id': 't3_1mb6kvk', 'comment_text': 'theyre most likely killing off the S pen to save 4 cents', 'comment_score': 29, 'comment_created_utc': 1753725885.0}, {'comment_id': 'n5oae94', 'parent_id': 't3_1mb6kvk', 'comment_text': ""Honestly, the Fold7 is my first folding phone, coming from the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra.

Now that it's back, I'm actually happy to be on the newest watch.

Now I previously never upgraded my smartwatch, because it's nowhere near the difference you get with upgrading a phone, and I've been stuck on the original Galaxy Watch because I love Tizen and didn't want to go to Wear OS, but Samsung kinda pushed me from that after discontinuing things and my biggest problem with Wear OS is that it was never fluid like Tizen was. I think they finally nailed that, especially with animations. My Watch6 Classic animations were laggy at times, and I don't see that with the 8.

The only things I see wrong so far is that you can't reverse wireless charge with it anymore, and even though the new watch bands are NICE... they're not universal. I grabbed a random watch I had in my collection and that band worked with my original Galaxy Watch.

1m8fr6z,How much battery have you lost over the year(s)?,"My Galaxy Note 9 has 50% degradation haha. (It doesn't have a battery protection feature so I'm not sure if that is why.) Same with my old iPhone.  
  
My daily driver Fold3 has always been set to 80% maximum charge (Settings->Battery->Battery Protection->Maximum Protection). The new battery capacity is 4400 mAh, the current capacity after 4 years of daily driving is 4275 mAh. It's about 3% of capacity loss. Just from my experience using it, I can't detect any capacity loss and the battery lasts around 2-3 days.

I'm curious what others are seeing and what to expect longer-term. I'll probably upgrade soon to the Fold7 but a lot of people (nephews, parents, cousins) want the hand-me-down Folds. It's still surprisingly rare to see one and they are fascinated by it.

1m7zl9b,Opinions of a long-time Samsung user,"I've been a long-time Samsung fan (my first Samsung was the S3, and I've stuck with the brand ever since). I own the full ecosystem, including a PC and wearable devices, and overall I've been happy with the experience.

That said, over the past few years, I’ve felt the quality steadily decline. My S22 (bought in 2023) started overheating and having battery issues after just a year, and eventually became unusable — the camera stopped working and the battery wouldn’t even last me through a day at university. So, I decided to switch to the S24, but now, a year later, I’m starting to see the same issues again: it overheats and the battery life keeps getting worse…

This brand is starting to feel less and less reliable to me with each passing year. I just want a phone that can last a few years, but even their flagship models don't seem to make it past two anymore.
The quality keeps going downhill, and I’m seriously thinking of moving away from Samsung soon.

1m4fsq2,From iSheep to Sam Fam,"Purchased S24U, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Galaxy Watch 7 last week. Switched from Apple Ecosystem to this.  Still use an iPad and a Mac but my iPhone 16 was to restricted. Was in the 'walled garden' for 3 years but after some time the Apple ecosystem features felt overrated. Using an iPhone when I could get my hands on the beast called S24 Ultra was too much for my gentle heart to bear. Don't even miss my Airpods and Apple Watch.

In my opinion, health tracking is better on Samsung since a unified view of all parameters is provided on Samsung Health app whereas on iPhone such parameters were scattered between Apple Health and Fitness App.

Sound quality is better on Galaxy Buds 3 pro though ANC is 8/10 on a scale where airpods prob2 anc would be 9/10.

Apart from the usual freedom that Android provides, Galaxy AI was a huge selling point. AI tools in Gallery are unparalleled compared to any such AI integration in the industry especially Apple.

1m27l9v,I really wanna get samsung Z flip 7,"Okay so Ive been an Iphone user for more than 10 years. Since last year my mind started to tell me to get Samsung. So I was waiting for the next Samsung ultra release until I found the new Samsung flip 7. And I can’t get it out of my mind 🥹🥹

Im soo in love with it!  
I really wanna know if it’s worth the money. As in, does the fold stay for more than 4 years? 
Everyone is telling you gotta be a bit delicate to handle a flip phone. So it’s stressing me a bit too.

Fragility:\nThis phone is extremely fragile. Even with cases that cover both the back sides, a fall, especially on the folded edge can be fatal. The hinge and inner screen are vulnerable, but there are cases that protect them, but its bulky and ruins the overall look and feel of the phone.\n\n2. Screen Protector Issues:\nThe pre-installed inner screen protector started showing large bubbles in the middle just 6 months in. It’s a known issue.\n\nIf you don’t replace it in time, the screen itself can crack.\n\nMy friend removed the screen protector after it came off on his Z Flip 5, and the screen broke the very next day, the replacement cost: INR 24,000 (USD 280).\n\nThe screen protector itself is expensive. I was quoted INR 1,600 (USD 20), and after a long argument with Samsung reps, they reduced it to INR 600 (USD 7).\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nIf you’re considering the Galaxy Z Flip 7, only buy it if you’re fully prepared to baby the phone.\nIt’s a premium product with a unique form factor, but the joy of the compact design fades quickly when you start worrying about screen bubbles, hinge falls, and pricey repairs.\n\nI personally regret getting the Flip and would’ve been much happier with a Galaxy S24 or even waiting for the S25.

1m0f6iw,"Samsung could dominate foldables today — they’re just choosing not to (CSC network band limitations, tiny batteries hinder longevity after charge cycles degradation)","Samsung has the best displays, multitasking UI, build quality, and the most efficient chipset – Snapdragon 8 Elite. They're this close to making the perfect foldable.

But year after year, they **hold back**:

- Still using a **tiny 4400 mAh battery** (unchanged for 4+ generations)  (aside from shorter daily runtime on a charge, the smaller battery is going to degrade much faster, requiring a replacement sooner)
- **Slow charging** compared to rivals  
- **CSC-based network band restrictions** that cripple global use  
  - e.g. US and Canada models used internationally can’t access hardware-supported bands without [unlocking](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-enable-all-bands-through-service-menu-on-us-ca-s23-series-including-sub-6-and-mmwave.4554611/), which they [took away on the S25](https://www.reddit.com/r/cellmapper/comments/1ie9qo1/s25_ultra_on_verizon_service_mode_menu_locked/) and [subsequently brought back in a beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/cellmapper/comments/1kxzfrp/oneui_8_beta_on_the_s25_ultra_appears_to_fix_73/) that may or may not last  
  - Even then, **Carrier Aggregation is crippled** globally, so LTE and 5G throughput takes a hit  
  - Importing a global model won't solve this either — you'll just have the opposite problem: good performance outside the US and Canada, **poor compatibility inside** them

Meanwhile, Chinese brands are shipping **5800+ mAh batteries** and **faster charging** in similar packages, proving it *can* be done.

And while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro Fold has better network support (even more bands than the iPhone 16 Pro Max) and longer software updates, it lacks Samsung’s polish and multitasking features. Plus, it’s thicker and heavier (257g vs Samsung’s 215g).

Samsung could fix most of this **tomorrow** — bigger battery, unlock bands, polish multitasking — but they won’t.

Because they’re still selling these at $2,000 a pop.  
They’re comfortable. Too comfortable.

---

Until us users push harder, they’ll keep drip-feeding us “upgrades” and calling it innovation.

Unfortunately, we realistically only have two options in the US and Canada: Samsung's Folds and Google's Folds. The Chinese brands omit support for US and Canada network bands and have even more software issues that make them a dealbreaker for many of us.

Hopefully, Samsung employees are reading this and taking this feedback seriously.",rayw_reddit,18,23,1752578607.0,"[{'comment_id': 'n3cs1o9', 'parent_id': 't3_1m0f6iw', 'comment_text': 'people still continue to buy them this subreddit everyone seemed eager to pre order it and pay only ""700"" for the phone acting like their zfold 6 was free or somthing lol', 'comment_score': 23, 'comment_created_utc': 1752622433.0}, {'comment_id': 'n3cuex9', 'parent_id': 't3_1m0f6iw', 'comment_text': 'Drip feeding innovation is lack of market competition.

It had a replaceable battery, and a high bandwidth data port for file management. It turned out, consumers liked the black berry look more for the aesthetic of being high business, not the actual functionality of that class (similar to ford F150s being used to haul groceries). \n\n\nSo Samsung pivoted with the s6, but still supported the note line up. When people walked into a store and saw a Samsung phone. The first one they always pivot to, was the note line up, not because of its big screen, but because of its pen. Were they note-takers? No, but they liked the aesthetic of one, so they get the closest thing to that, which is the S line. This continues throughout the ultra line, and with the foldables. Samsung removes things like headphone ports, removable batteries, IR sensors so on; but they keep the s-pen and even add dex. Because someone there knew how vital it was to the appearance of the brand. \n\n\nNow with this most recent one, they remove the s-pen. Did people use it? Sure some Artists, Beauty Influencers, Accountants, Small businesses, Healthcare, Students, etc, but majority of the user-base didn’t. \n\n\nSome people in Samsung wanted to make the phone slimmer, looked at the data, and sacrificed the digitizer.  It seems someone somewhere forgot or maybe does not know why people chose Samsung over any other Brand. \n\n\nWhat confuses me, is why now?

Being able to simply hold home and then select some text (that may not be selectable otherwise) or tap an image to quickly research text or an image in a pop-up window, without having to (manually) open a new tab/app to search in is frequently very convenient. Being able to do similar such stuff with ""Smart Select"" using my S-pen is also quite handy other times. As someone that frequently browses browses/views content in other languages (despite only knowing English well), I\'m also a huge fan of the ability to quickly translate stuff in any language to English on this phone, be it by translating the entire screen at any given moment with Circle to Search or by translating text I point the S-pen at with the Air Command menu\'s Translate option.\n\nHaving said all that, the translation functionality is not as simple, fluid, and universal as I imagine it theoretically could be. With Circle to Search, I need to repeatedly hold home and tap translate every time I reach a new screen or see new text. With the S-pen translation, I need to keep pointing at every little bit of foreign text I want to understand. Many browser applications already allow you to automatically translate pages in foreign languages to your own language, but it\'d be nice if this functionality was available at a system level, so foreign languages across any app could automatically be translated into your language.\n\nBasic level would just be automatically translating selectable text, but it\'d be extra nice if they could also translate text in images and maybe even translate audio (when Live Captions are active). That way, I could say, watch a Japanese-speaking livestreamer in an app like Youtube or Twitch and at least understand what their primarily Japanese-speaking viewers are saying in their chat, plus possibly understand the streamer. Samsung already has AI functionality to translate calls, texts, and spoken conversations, so it\'d be nice if this could just be a more universal and automatic thing.\n\nAlso, on another note, I log all my meals in Samsung Health and regularly wind up having to add custom foods because the FatSecret database is hardly all-encompassing. However it\'s a huge hassle to have to enter the food name and up to 15 different nutrient values for every custom food... especially when the order of nutrients on labels isn\'t too consistent. Would be amazing if there was a function (through AI or otherwise) that let me point my phone camera at a nutritional label to extract the nutrient numbers and populate them in a custom food. Even better if it can analyze an image/table with nutritional details for several items at some (fast) food place and automatically pull the relevant numbers for the item name you specify (cause good god it\'s an ordeal with some of those nutrition sheets when they have dozens of rows/columns in a static PDF/image).', 'comment_score': 2, 'comment_created_utc': 1752085192.0}, {'comment_id': 'n3euug5', 'parent_id': 't3_1lupezw', 'comment_text': ""I just want a button that turns it all off.

It\'d also be nice to have better routing options when not driving. I\'d like to be able to automate tracked facial blurring/covering in videos. More advanced daily briefing could also be nice, maybe using notification history (like integrating with Canvas/Google Classroom to pull assignment due dates, using GPS to show local events, etc). Smart playlists might be fun (like fitting the activity, weather, traveled to area, etc) (probably removing the very top results if they\'re too generic).\n\nPulling info from messages or being able to scan cards in Wallet is nice, so being able to expand that with the camera or a scanner would be cool. More editing and refining options for commands would also be good (like anything that involves ""ads [look up info] to my calendar"").\n\nBeing able to disable it would also be really nice ofc. I like having more RAM, processing power, battery, and storage available on my device, so having an off toggle would be nice (even for people that do enjoy using AI sometimes).\n\nEdit: anywhere a company wants to do AI generated images I\'d rather have a collage or something. Like, using an AI to select real photos, roughly cut them out and position them together. It\'d make it less grating on the eyes. If AI generated text and images are to be used, they should be used in a way that couldn\'t just be done with a standard chatbot, like generating a description of every photo in a library so it\'d be easier to search through, or generating an image of a description and then checking for matches online to use instead or direct to.

Right in front of my eyes the last 4 archived ones were gone. Into the ether. The settings doesn't give you a time limit as to how long you can keep your messages.

Until I found out that some utterly incompetent manager decided to make it impossible to have multipoint with non-Samsung devices.

What were they even thinking? Do they really expect us to ditch our expensive laptops for some Samsung product just to have multipoint with their earbuds?

Result: I am not buying the Samsung product. Now there is a chance I will get acquainted with a direct competitor's ecosystem.

1lpvjwi,Diabolical customer service,"Has anyone else experienced this diabolical customer service from Samsung? 

I received aGalaxy S25 and Galaxy Buds Pro3 on the 3rd of June, I wasn’t happy with it so I retuned it on the 6th of June. 

Passed from online rep to online rep only to be passed back to the original online rep who originally couldn’t do the return for me but then finally did the return and told me I’ll have a full refund in 14 days. 

DPD lost the parcel at their sorting facility (obviously stolen). 

I chased Samsung and they told me I have to deal with DPD myself even though I’ve tried contacting DPD and I can’t get through to anyone. 

So I reached out to Samsung again, they’ve escalated it so they can investigate why it’s taking so long. 

I then get an email asking me for the tacking number of the return they generated for me. 

A few days later, I receive an email saying they’re gonna exchange the phone for me, with no mention of the Galaxy buds EVEN THOUGH I REQUESTED A REFUND NOT AN EXCHANGE. 

I’ve emailed Samsung again asking why they’ve done this. No reply. I’ve now sent them another email expressing how angry I am and wanting to raise a complaint. 

I’ve spoken with my credit card provider and they’re doing a chargeback thing for me. 

Has anyone else experienced such shitty customer service??

I bought an S8 Ultra tablet in early 2022 with a new S22U; there were a ton of promotions going on, many discounts, but the one thing that really got me to buy the tablet was the offering of a free keyboard cover.\n\nThat cover worked like twice, and never has since. I tried to get it replaced but was told none were in stock. I checked back in months later, was told that I was being sent one. Another month later, nothing, so I co tact them again and am told there's no record of any of that. But of course no replacement is currently available. Then another ticket was logged for me but of course nothing ever came of it either and I just had to accept the BS of receiving a faulty product that will never get replaced.\n\nAnd now just look at the S22U overheating debacle after the 6.1 update last year. Mine fell victim to it but Samsung has yet to acknowledge anything.
