I honestly don't remember much of the Fold6's camera, which I guess speaks for itself. It didn't leave me impressed, especially coming from an S24 Ultra and iPhone 15PM. The Fold7's primary lens holds its own from the shots I've taken so far, I don't feel like I'm taking a step down using it like I did with the Fold6.

">	will it tough to switch over? I don‚Äôt believe I have any iOS-exclusive apps, but I do use iCloud for syncing photos, etc.

There‚Äôll be an adjustment period but if you don‚Äôt use anything iOS exclusive you‚Äôll probably be fine. Mainstream apps do feel a little more polished on iOS though. 

There are other cloud services you can replace iCloud with. For me, the biggest hurdle to switching would be the ecosystem niceties, those are hard to replace if you‚Äôre not switching every single device over to Samsung/Windows equivalents.

It‚Äôs fine for light to medium usage but heavier usage like you‚Äôre describing will need a top up in the evening. I‚Äôve been getting around 5 hours SOT with some navigation, but no gaming.

"Durability for one, a phone with moving parts will never be as durable as one without. The inner display is still a plastic polymer laminate with 50 micron thick glass middle layer you never touch, which means I have to constantly be mindful of how hard I press. I don‚Äôt want to manually think ‚Äúis my screen okay, did I press too hard?‚Äù that alone is a compromised experience.

Material choice is another issue. For $2000 I expect premium materials, yet this uses the same aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 as the baseline Galaxy S25. At this level of thickness, titanium paired with Gorilla Armor should have been standard. Titanium has vastly higher tensile strength than aluminum alloys, so its omission is surprising.

The camera system is mostly on par with the S25 Ultra, but it‚Äôs missing the periscope telephoto lens the only other lens I actually care about. The ultra wide can be dropped for all it‚Äôs worth.

Battery life is still mediocre. Silicon carbide batteries have been in the works and would realistically provide about 50% more life at the same thickness. The only reason I can imagine this wasn‚Äôt implemented is to hold it back as the Z Fold 8‚Äôs main selling point planned obsolescence at work.

Finally, dropping S Pen functionality is just strange. A larger inner canvas would only benefit from stylus support. Even if there‚Äôs no space to store one internally, compatibility should have been preserved.

The most amount of money buys you a curiosity that is visually stunning but still paired back and contains flaws that muddle the experience.

">In 2014, Apple and Samsung were duking it out to rule the U.S. smartphone market. Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.

>It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.

>But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it‚Äôs all about the screen.

>In the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple‚Äôs market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.

>Apple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It‚Äôs often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.

>That‚Äôs one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung‚Äôs stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.

>Apple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.

>In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung‚Äôs catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge. 

>The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.

>One user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.

>In the past month, Samsung‚Äôs premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.

>The market share numbers aren‚Äôt just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.

>But Samsung‚Äôs gains also reflect the company‚Äôs ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung‚Äôs second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.

>Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy and Z phone lineup ‚Äústretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,‚Äù said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. ‚ÄúThere is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.‚Äù

>Samsung‚Äôs first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers ‚Äî including CNBC ‚Äî discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.

>But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.

>‚ÄúThere really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,‚Äù said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.

>The South Korean company doesn‚Äôt provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device‚Äôs predecessor by nearly 50%.

>‚ÄúSamsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,‚Äù said Bjorhovde. ‚ÄùTry to be ahead, show that something is different, and there‚Äôs a certain halo effect from that.‚Äù

>According to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung‚Äôs sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a ‚Äúslight boost‚Äù from the slim S25 Edge.

>Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google‚Äôs Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can‚Äôt get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.

>Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google‚Äôs circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they‚Äôd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.

>On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.",1,>in <num>  apple and samsung

since i cant post here my self, where can i post if i have a problem with my phone?

My problem: My S21 FE has a touchscreen error, and now that it has been restarted, I can no longer enter my password.

To be precise, only the ‚Äú1‚Äù doesn't work.

Since the device requires the password once when booting up, this is really difficult.

An external keyboard doesn't work.

Rotating the keyboard doesn't work.

Making the keyboard smaller doesn't work.

Entering the number 1 at ""emergency call"" works, but cannot be copied.

any other ideas?

"Apple faces a fundamental challenge if it wants its rumored iFold to compete with Samsung‚Äôs foldables: escaping the limitations of plastic polymer laminate displays. Unless Apple breaks that barrier, Samsung‚Äôs technology now on track for an eighth generation lead will continue to set the standard. Fortunately for Apple, Corning‚Äôs Willow Glass has existed since 2012, though so far it has been confined to R&D labs rather than mass production. For context, Samsung‚Äôs current UTG measures just 50 microns before protective layers and the titanium backing plate. Willow Glass, by contrast, can be manufactured as thin as 100 microns, which in theory offers a stronger foundation. If Apple wants to leapfrog rather than merely catch up, it will need to harness Willow Glass or an equivalent breakthrough before Samsung widens the gap even further.

I suspect Apple‚Äôs iFold will follow the same path as the Vision Pro: a slick, unmistakably Apple take on the category, loaded with polish and unique design choices. But arriving so late to the foldable race means it‚Äôs destined to remain an ultra expensive, niche product, one that appeals mostly to die hard Apple loyalists rather than reshaping the broader market.",0,apple faces a fundamental challenge if it wants its rumored ifold to compete with samsung s foldables  escaping the limitations of plastic polymer laminate displays  unless apple breaks that barrier  samsung s technology now on track for an eighth generation lead will continue to set the standard  fortunately for apple  corning s willow glass has existed since <num>  though so far it has been confined to r d labs rather than mass production  for context  samsung s current utg measures just <num> microns before protective layers and the titanium backing plate  willow glass  by contrast  can be manufactured as thin as <num> microns  which in theory offers a stronger foundation  if apple wants to leapfrog rather than merely catch up  it will need to harness willow glass or an equivalent breakthrough before samsung widens the gap even further  i suspect apple s ifold will follow the same path as the vision pro  a slick  unmistakably apple take on the category  loaded with polish and unique design choices  but arriving so late to the foldable race means it s destined to remain an ultra expensive  niche product  one that appeals mostly to die hard apple loyalists rather than reshaping the broader market

"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, a 2025 foldable phone, offers a blend of innovation and practicality.¬†Its pros include a large, immersive screen, powerful AI capabilities, and a refined, lightweight design.¬†However, cons include a high price point and the potential for hinge and screen fragility.¬†The Z Fold7 is a top-tier foldable, but its unique features come with trade-offs.¬†Pros:

* **Large, Immersive Display:**The 8-inch main screen provides a tablet-like experience, ideal for media consumption, multitasking, and creative tasks.¬†
* **AI-Powered Features:**The phone's AI capabilities enhance photo editing, optimize performance, and potentially offer other intelligent features, as highlighted by the ""AI Photo Edits"" feature.¬†
* **Refined and Lightweight Design:**Compared to previous Fold models, the Z Fold7 is slimmer, lighter, and feels more like a traditional smartphone when folded.¬†
* **Enhanced Durability:**The device boasts improvements like a stronger hinge and thicker folding screen glass, suggesting increased durability compared to earlier foldable phones.
* **Long Battery Life:**The phone offers a ""long battery life,"" likely able to last a full day for moderate users.¬†
* **Versatile Camera System:**The 200MP main camera with Pro-Visual Engine ensures high-quality photos.¬†
* **Edge-to-Edge Display:**The wider cover screen, now at 6.5 inches, and the larger inner screen offer an expansive viewing experience, according to a YouTube review.¬†
* **Flex Mode:**Allows for hands-free video calls and other tasks by folding the phone at various angles.¬†

Cons:

* **High Price:**As a premium foldable device, the Z Fold7 is expected to have a high price tag.¬†
* **Potential for Hinge and Screen Fragility:**Despite improvements, foldable phones can still be more susceptible to damage than traditional smartphones, especially around the hinge area and folding screen.¬†
* **No S Pen Support:**Unlike some previous Fold models, the Z Fold7 may not support the S Pen.¬†
* **Camera Limitations:**While boasting a 200MP sensor, the camera system might lack a 5x telephoto lens, which some users may prefer.
* **Charging Speed:**The phone's charging speed may not be as fast as some users might expect, despite Samsung's branding.¬†
* **IP Rating:**The IP48 rating indicates basic water and dust resistance, but it may not be as robust as some users might prefer.¬†",1,the samsung galaxy z fold<num>  a <num> foldable phone  offers a blend of innovation and practicality ¬†its pros include a large  immersive screen  powerful ai capabilities  and a refined  lightweight design ¬†however  cons include a high price point and the potential for hinge and screen fragility ¬†the z fold<num> is a top tier foldable  but its unique features come with trade offs ¬†pros      large  immersive display   the <num> inch main screen provides a tablet like experience  ideal for media consumption  multitasking  and creative tasks ¬†     ai powered features   the phone s ai capabilities enhance photo editing  optimize performance  and potentially offer other intelligent features  as highlighted by the  ai photo edits  feature ¬†     refined and lightweight design   compared to previous fold models  the z fold<num> is slimmer  lighter  and feels more like a traditional smartphone when folded ¬†     enhanced durability   the device boasts improvements like a stronger hinge and thicker folding screen glass  suggesting increased durability compared to earlier foldable phones      long battery life   the phone offers a  long battery life   likely able to last a full day for moderate users ¬†     versatile camera system   the <num>mp main camera with pro visual engine ensures high quality photos ¬†     edge to edge display   the wider cover screen  now at <num> <num> inches  and the larger inner screen offer an expansive viewing experience  according to a youtube review ¬†     flex mode   allows for hands free video calls and other tasks by folding the phone at various angles ¬† cons      high price   as a premium foldable device  the z fold<num> is expected to have a high price tag ¬†     potential for hinge and screen fragility   despite improvements  foldable phones can still be more susceptible to damage than traditional smartphones  especially around the hinge area and folding screen ¬†     no s pen support   unlike some previous fold models  the z fold<num> may not support the s pen ¬†     camera limitations   while boasting a <num>mp sensor  the camera system might lack a <num>x telephoto lens  which some users may prefer      charging speed   the phone s charging speed may not be as fast as some users might expect  despite samsung s branding ¬†     ip rating   the ip<num> rating indicates basic water and dust resistance  but it may not be as robust as some users might prefer ¬†

"I had a A52s 5G which I used from January 2022 to December 2024 after which it was still running perfectly with no issues and nearly perfect physical condition. I gave it to my sister, hopefully it keeps trucking on in her hands...

I'm now on an S22 Ultra which I bought used (through Koodo) in December, which is working fine. Sometimes it seems like 2 small regions of the screen don't register the stylus tip as well (not an issue for me) but that was happening ever since I first got it. So far so good.

In the past I had an iPod touch 5 which worked from 2014 to 2017 or so where I think it overheated; and an iPhone 6 from 2017 which is working to this day, also in great physical condition.

Also have a Xiaomi Mi A2 which, besides the random bootloops it sometimes gets for no fucking reason, is still in perfect condition that I used from 2019 to 2022.

"To be fair, it's just a cheap A16 5G. I just got it recently. It's my first Samsung phone and I just wanted to try a cheap phone. I went with this cheap phone ($200 from Samsung directly) because it comes with 6 years of updates.

That bodes well, or at least optimistic, but I am not 'hard' on phones. I'm not a heavy user. So, hopefully, it will last.

My only real complaint is that it lies to me about the charging time. It seems to assume I've already bought the charging brick for the high speed charging. That was not included in the box. I've yet to buy one, though I might as well. Dirty thing is a liar...

Anyhow, my last phone was an old LG that survived years of use. I'm looking for a new family of devices to buy into, which was also why I went cheap. I can afford a much fancier phone and may do so, but I first want to feel the company out.

"**My S10e G970F/DS. 128GB/6GB. Popped a 256GB SD card in there too to keep music on.**

I had ""upgraded"" to an S24 B/DS and actually find that phone to be inferior in just about every way... After owning it for 4 months I'm just going to sell it. Each update made it worse, removed features, or made it slower....bah.

Not only does my s10e work... It just works better than my S24.  
It is thinner, Smaller, lighter and better shaped for the hand.  
The display is sharper ( higher PPI - and I find it has less black crush)

In my testing around my house, at car and motorcycle shows, snapping moving objects, the S10e is over all more sharp with better edge definition and contrast in its images. The S24 is soft, and washed out by comparison. The s10e while often over saturated, still gets the over all color feel of a scene closer to reality than the washed out photos the S24 takes. This is not even Hyperbole : look up the test photos on GSM arena. In good lighting the S10e is WAY sharper...and in low lighting is nearly as good as the 5 year newer phone.

The OS is hands down better : I actually find that many apps are MORE responsive on my S10e, than on the much newer more powerful S24...One UI7 was a disaster for me and removed many features I consider requirements ( such as non grouped notifications...) Heck, even android auto is more responsive when using my S10e. I have never been so disappointed with a phone before as I am with the S24.

"Absolutely not. It was my first Android device and it almost made me swear off Samsung until the S9+ won me back over. Touchwiz was a nightmare, bloated, ugly and surprisingly rigid to customize outside of rooting. The plastic body felt cheap, the stupid charging flap was annoying, the front and rear cameras sucked in lowlight, 2GB of RAM was not enough to keep more than 2 apps in memory, updates were late and full of bloatware, the single mono speaker on the back sucked and was awkwardly placed for watching videos, the headphone jack amp was surprisingly underpowered...I can go on. The only saving grace was that beautiful AMOLED screen that got me hooked on Samsung manufactured OLEDs which every smart device I've owned since then use.¬†

">Near the beginning of the year, market analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that Samsung may have set a shipment target of 40 million units for the Galaxy S25 series. According to new information, Samsung exceeded 20 million Galaxy S25 sales by the end of June and outsold every other Snapdragon 8 Elite phone combined.

>So far, Samsung's flagship series has been a global success, but to put things into perspective, we can compare global Snapdragon 8 Elite sales. Leaker @UniverseIce shared some fun facts that shed some light on Samsung's performance compared to its Android rivals.

>The Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra exclusively use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip globally. More specifically, these Samsung premium phones are equipped with a special edition ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.

>What's interesting is that, thanks to the Galaxy S25 series, Qualcomm sold more than 20 million Snapdragon 8 Elite ‚Äúfor Galaxy‚Äù chips, making this version more popular than the standard one.

>Reportedly, the combined sales of the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which other Android OEMs used for their premium phones, were lower than 20 million.

>In other words, not only does this show that Samsung's exclusive Elite version is by far the most popular in the world, but it also means that the Galaxy S25 series alone outsold all of its other Android competitors combined ‚Äî at least those who used the standard version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in their phones.

>Samsung is Qualcomm's most profitable smartphone partner, judging by sales. Ironically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, which Qualcomm and Samsung co-developed, is more popular than the base version developed solely by Qualcomm.

No matter what I tried, the OneDrive backup built into the Samsung Gallery app wouldn't maintain my albums, and Google Photos wouldn't do it at all. I'd recommend just transferring your entire library to Google Photos, then (using a Mac ideally) manually download important albums one at a time from iCloud and create them manually in Google Photos.

"Switching from iOS to Android is as painless or as painful as your level of immersion in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. If your usage revolves around Apple Music and little else, the transition is straightforward: the primary inconvenience is repurchasing apps you previously bought on iOS, as most apps need to be purchased again for Android.

However, if you rely heavily on Apple exclusive apps like Pages, Keynote, or strictly Apple‚Äôs iCloud services without integrating Google services, which is increasingly rare even among the most loyal Apple users the process becomes more frustrating. Converting or exporting existing work, syncing documents, and maintaining continuity across devices can be a significant headache.

For my own setup, I‚Äôve been a Galaxy S phone user and iPad Pro user for over six years. Apple Music works seamlessly across platforms, making the audio transition effortless. Apple Photos, synced with Google Photos, ensures that even the rare times I snap a photo on my iPad, it‚Äôs instantly available on my phone without extra steps. In other words, thoughtful cross platform use of services can dramatically smooth the transition from iOS to Android.

Colleagues often ask me, ‚ÄúWhy not just use an iPhone so you don‚Äôt have to deal with all that manual setup?‚Äù The truth is, iOS and iPadOS are essentially the same ecosystem. iPadOS only recently got its own name, and even then, the differences from iOS are mostly limited to features like Split View and the dock for multitasking. Beyond that, it‚Äôs largely a carbon copy of the iPhone interface.

don‚Äôt want two identical devices. If I were going to use an iPad the same way as an iPhone, I might as well find a workaround to make calls on the iPad too but that defeats the point. I prefer keeping devices distinct in purpose and experience, rather than duplicating functionality across hardware.

iPad pro is my media consumption device when I want a larger screen, yes large video with minimal letter boxing unlike the galaxy fold which is a horrible 3.75:3 aspect ratio ( nearly square ) which makes video content negligibly large than the S25 ultra.

"I was quite disappointed by the Buds 3 Pro. Samsung's new tip setup is almost designed to result in broken eartips because of the flimsy plastic shells they put inside the earbuds. I've broken 2 so far. 

Moreover, they just don't fit securely in my ears no matter which tip size I use. Talking on the phone for more than a couple minutes usually results in them starting to slip out and having to constantly readjust. 

The fact that their multipoint connection only works with Samsung devices is frustrating and inconvenient as well, and bizarrely the microphones seem to not work with non-Samsung Windows PCs. I frequently use my earbuds for making calls through my work laptop and I can't use these for that. 

The sound quality is really excellent, but unfortunately they have far too many design flaws and downsides. I just ordered a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2. I have the first gen of those and the universal multipoint connection is a huge plus for me, and from all the reviews I've seen of gen 2 the wing tip makes for a very secure fit.",0,i was quite disappointed by the buds <num> pro  samsung s new tip setup is almost designed to result in broken eartips because of the flimsy plastic shells they put inside the earbuds  i ve broken <num> so far   moreover  they just don t fit securely in my ears no matter which tip size i use  talking on the phone for more than a couple minutes usually results in them starting to slip out and having to constantly readjust   the fact that their multipoint connection only works with samsung devices is frustrating and inconvenient as well  and bizarrely the microphones seem to not work with non samsung windows pcs  i frequently use my earbuds for making calls through my work laptop and i can t use these for that   the sound quality is really excellent  but unfortunately they have far too many design flaws and downsides  i just ordered a pair of pixel buds pro <num>  i have the first gen of those and the universal multipoint connection is a huge plus for me  and from all the reviews i ve seen of gen <num> the wing tip makes for a very secure fit

"The Buds 3 Pro have presented some challenges. The redesigned eartip attachment mechanism, featuring delicate plastic components, appears prone to breakage, as evidenced by two instances of failure.

Furthermore, achieving a secure fit has proven difficult, regardless of the eartip size selected. Extended phone conversations often necessitate frequent readjustment due to slippage.

The limited multipoint connectivity, restricted to Samsung devices, is a notable inconvenience, compounded by reported microphone incompatibility with non-Samsung Windows PCs. This limitation hinders their usability for calls via a work laptop.

While the sound quality is commendable, these design shortcomings significantly detract from the overall user experience. Consequently, a transition to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 has been initiated. The universal multipoint connectivity of the original Pixel Buds Pro, coupled with the reported secure fit of the second generation's wing tip design, are key factors in this decision.",0,the buds <num> pro have presented some challenges  the redesigned eartip attachment mechanism  featuring delicate plastic components  appears prone to breakage  as evidenced by two instances of failure  furthermore  achieving a secure fit has proven difficult  regardless of the eartip size selected  extended phone conversations often necessitate frequent readjustment due to slippage  the limited multipoint connectivity  restricted to samsung devices  is a notable inconvenience  compounded by reported microphone incompatibility with non samsung windows pcs  this limitation hinders their usability for calls via a work laptop  while the sound quality is commendable  these design shortcomings significantly detract from the overall user experience  consequently  a transition to the pixel buds pro <num> has been initiated  the universal multipoint connectivity of the original pixel buds pro  coupled with the reported secure fit of the second generation s wing tip design  are key factors in this decision

Buying a folding phone only to use that larger screen 10% of the time just seems like wasted money to me. And honestly every app I needed worked perfectly fine with that screen. Streaming apps, social media, multiple music apps all worked find. Only game via Xbox streaming and that was fine.

"I will give you some insight into reliability based on my own experience.

I got my Zfold 5 2 years ago.  I work in an extreme environment and bring it into very dangerous areas. To be clear, I am a steelman working with a furnace.  The area is wildly hot, dusty, and dangerous. I somewhat regularly work in areas that exceed 200‚Å∞F.

My outer screen is beyond fucked.  Mainly because I dropped my phone on a rough surface a number of times, and it breaks more and more.  It's still totally usable.

My hinge is dented and scratched from drops. The hinge mechanism still works flawlessly.

My inner screen has no issues to speak of.  The built-in screen protector has no peeling or cracking to note.

I have never put a case or screen protector on my phone and, outside of a broken screen (like anyones phone that has been dropped too many times), this thing refuses to die.

"I open that screen its guaranteed to melt in many instances.  In others, it will get materials on it that would chemically melt it. Or, at minimum, it would cause dirt to sandwich between the screen to imprint when shut.  

The heat I deal with is so extreme that my own clothes have burned me when I shifted.  My phone was in my pocket while I was worried about the screen inside melting and fusing my screen shut. Shifting while standing still caused my own panta to burn my legs. There was one scenario a few months ago where the heat I was dealing with far exceeded 200‚Å∞. Exposed skin cooked.  The only thing between the phone and that heat was my normal regular pants.  The heat has also quite literally melted the soles of my boots.  Hanging out much longer in that heat, my feet begin to cook as well.  The ground is so hot it will ignite wood and other materials that aren't treated to resist ignition. Opening my phone guaranteed melting my screen.  It should have honestly fused while folded in my pocket, honestly.

I have taken videos of materials so hot that when I handle my phone again, it is almost too hot to touch the areas exposed to the material.  Have you ever had 50+ tons of liquid steel get dumped to make a waterfall in front of you?  Likely not.

The environment is dusty.  Like, a week of no cleaning, there is an inch of extremely fine dust/dirt.  So fine, it will make it past the hinge guaranteed.  In some areas, especially ones I pass through, there is airborn lime and other materials I can not mention.  That lime gets on my screen, then I touch with my sweaty hands, and I have created an acid on the inner screen that will melt it chemically.

That all being said, I do open my phone quite a bit.  People outside of this line of work just cannot fathom what the environment is like.  My phone is always in my pocket and at extreme risk.

2 years later and that inner screen hasnt shown signs of wear, even though I do touch it with grimey nasty hands, and everything around me is covered in a fine dust.  I even find that my inner screen has a light dusting that I have to clean off most of the time.  If I swiped with a clean hand, my fingers would come back brown/black.  Why is it pristine?

"Do they not make phone cases that hold the stylus?  If you're not able to spend that much right now then that could be another option.

(Everything from here forward is based off what I'm seeing on the samsung app from the states so my apologies if you don't live here because I'm not sure if Samsung discounts are the same everywhere)

From what I searched up the base model of the Note 9 was $999.99 though, so you already spent at least that much 7 or so years ago so if your financial situation hasn't changed much then going ahead with getting an s25 ultra wouldn't be much different.

The base s25 ultra model has 256gb and is $1299.99, and if you trade in your Note 9(and it's not cracked) you'll get $135 off(or $50 if cracked).  That's $1164.99(or $1249.99 if cracked).

Right now there's also a promotion for $300 off, making it $999.99.  Keep in mind that you can't do a trade in and this promotion though.

Of course this is all for just the base price of the phone and the coverage/care plans are a whole other fiasco.

It's looking better now, that pay cut job sucked (as I knew) but gave me the freedom to get another (smaller cut) job. The 2nd job gave me a raise and now I'm making more than my original and in a better position, cheaper and better insurance, closer to home by far etc. I've been building back up.",1,you are correct    they ve actually come down in price when i googled to make sure i had the correct model which was a pleasant surprise  i d also had a rough set of months when i looked originally too  had to fix my hvac  got in a wreck  and a plumbing issue   around <num> total   i also took a new job knowing it was a pretty decent pay cut   it s looking better now  that pay cut job sucked  as i knew  but gave me the freedom to get another  smaller cut  job  the <num>nd job gave me a raise and now i m making more than my original and in a better position  cheaper and better insurance  closer to home by far etc  i ve been building back up

"Maybe my jeans do enough shielding to prevent extreme damage.  It's not like the phone is directly exposed to the heat, and a decent amount of material does get into my pocket.

I was literally inside of a steel furnace like 3 weeks ago.  Melted my boots and caught a pallet on fire that was holding our bricks. We had to renew the bricks and other materials that line a steel furnace.  We can't stay inside longer than 15-20 minutes and must get out to cool down and drink obscene amounts of water. That furnace had only cooled for a total of maybe 6 hours after dumping out the last of the steel inside.

Im not claiming my phone is indestructible, my cover screen can attest to that.  I am just saying they are stronger than people think and it takes more than people claim to have issues with the hinge, inner screen, and other functions.

Believe what you want.  I live it almost every day and know what this thing is put through.  I didn't think I could trust a foldable.  But I make enough money doing what I do to take the risk on an expensive phone.  When this one inevitably dies, I will get a new one again.  These things are stupid tough.

"So I switched over from iPhone 16 pro to the S25. I needed a phone which covered what I needed rather than the same thing everyone else had

Things I love:
 -one hand operations mode, I have one of the actions to bring up a quick menu which has all the mains apps I use on a daily basis

- sound assistance, I'm a nerd i like listening to audio books and having some music play silently behind it, sound assistance easily allows me to do that.

- Samsung Dex, if I'm being lazy and cba to get my laptop I plug in my phone and whip out notes and my lecture videos side by side.

- split screen has been helpful in some occasions, unsure if that's just a samsung feature or android.

Cons
- Camera is wack but don't take enough pictures to care
- hate the fact there is no express travel like on iphones so have to unlock my phone to pay for contactless travel
- iPhone App integration for certain apps I have to make payments to is way better than on samsumg mostly due to the fact that Apple Pay is integrated into these apps whereas there's no Google pay or Samsung pay for them",1,so i switched over from iphone <num> pro to the s<num>  i needed a phone which covered what i needed rather than the same thing everyone else had things i love    one hand operations mode  i have one of the actions to bring up a quick menu which has all the mains apps i use on a daily basis   sound assistance  i m a nerd i like listening to audio books and having some music play silently behind it  sound assistance easily allows me to do that    samsung dex  if i m being lazy and cba to get my laptop i plug in my phone and whip out notes and my lecture videos side by side    split screen has been helpful in some occasions  unsure if that s just a samsung feature or android  cons   camera is wack but don t take enough pictures to care   hate the fact there is no express travel like on iphones so have to unlock my phone to pay for contactless travel   iphone app integration for certain apps i have to make payments to is way better than on samsumg mostly due to the fact that apple pay is integrated into these apps whereas there s no google pay or samsung pay for them

I'm surprised you missed that it was plastered everywhere about the complaints. I'm with you on being upset that it's removed. I actually skipped the phone altogether because of this. I was able to find a brand new fold5  still in box that I got. I'll wait around until the fold 8 or 9 and if they haven't brought it back I'll just get a used Samsung tablet that has s pen support and I can get over the loss of having UDC as well at that point but I'm holding out hope that they'll bring these missing features back. If you look back at all the generations of the folds you'll see so many features removed that actually were pretty great Not sure why they do this  in the search of being the thinnest phone for all but a day until the next company gets a thinner one lol,1,i m surprised you missed that it was plastered everywhere about the complaints  i m with you on being upset that it s removed  i actually skipped the phone altogether because of this  i was able to find a brand new fold<num>  still in box that i got  i ll wait around until the fold <num> or <num> and if they haven t brought it back i ll just get a used samsung tablet that has s pen support and i can get over the loss of having udc as well at that point but i m holding out hope that they ll bring these missing features back  if you look back at all the generations of the folds you ll see so many features removed that actually were pretty great not sure why they do this  in the search of being the thinnest phone for all but a day until the next company gets a thinner one lol

I anticipate the future integration of this feature. However, as a first-time Fold user, I am impressed. I have adapted to typing notes on my mobile device while continuing to utilize the pen on my tablet.

This phone has exceeded expectations. The durable and portable design has significantly enhanced my workflow. It has streamlined on-the-go multitasking. The experience of consuming content, such as comics, reading materials, and multimedia, has been exceptional.

Two iPhone users have transitioned to this device after experiencing its multitasking capabilities.

Samsung always stresses how we should be using their cords, wall chargers, wireless chargers, etc. Well we would if they'd cut the price down and make better products.

"I have a Galaxy S21. 4 Years, no issues. But 1 week ago, the phone started to have mobile network issues. Mobile internet, whether 5G or 4G, is no longer stable, and it often falls back to 3G mode and stays there, which is nearly unusable. Activating and deactivating flight mode will provide around 5 to 15 minutes of 5G connectivity, after which it reverts to 3G. Replacing the SIM card, deleting the network cache, and other solutions only work for up to 15 minutes after it reverts again to 3G. I once had the issue that I was in a parking basement and had no network or internet available to pay for the parking lot, while my wife's iPhone 14 still had 4G available there. She gave me a hotspot to pay for the parking.

The odd thing is that the mobile network provider and several repair shops are telling me that many models of Samsung Galaxy S24 and down have started with these issues for at least one week.

"My Galaxy S21 has functioned reliably for four years. However, approximately one week ago, the device began experiencing mobile network connectivity problems. Specifically, the mobile internet connection, regardless of whether it is 5G or 4G, has become unstable, frequently reverting to 3G mode, rendering it nearly unusable. While toggling airplane mode temporarily restores 5G connectivity for approximately 5 to 15 minutes, the issue invariably recurs. Troubleshooting steps, including SIM card replacement and network cache clearing, provide only temporary relief, with the problem reemerging within 15 minutes. Notably, I encountered a situation in a parking garage where I was unable to access a network or internet connection to pay for parking, while my wife's iPhone 14 maintained a 4G signal. She subsequently provided a hotspot for payment.

Interestingly, both my mobile network provider and several repair shops have indicated that numerous Samsung Galaxy models, including the S24 and earlier versions, have exhibited similar network issues within the past week. Furthermore, this issue appears to affect multiple mobile network providers.",1,my galaxy s<num> has functioned reliably for four years  however  approximately one week ago  the device began experiencing mobile network connectivity problems  specifically  the mobile internet connection  regardless of whether it is <num>g or <num>g  has become unstable  frequently reverting to <num>g mode  rendering it nearly unusable  while toggling airplane mode temporarily restores <num>g connectivity for approximately <num> to <num> minutes  the issue invariably recurs  troubleshooting steps  including sim card replacement and network cache clearing  provide only temporary relief  with the problem reemerging within <num> minutes  notably  i encountered a situation in a parking garage where i was unable to access a network or internet connection to pay for parking  while my wife s iphone <num> maintained a <num>g signal  she subsequently provided a hotspot for payment  interestingly  both my mobile network provider and several repair shops have indicated that numerous samsung galaxy models  including the s<num> and earlier versions  have exhibited similar network issues within the past week  furthermore  this issue appears to affect multiple mobile network providers

Let me explain better: In my opinion, for 4 years up to today, all high-end phones (S series in Samsung, and iPhones) have reached a level of hardware power (12GB RAM, 512GB storage) much higher than can ever be exploited by their software (in normal use, but also for the majority of phone games), so it no longer makes sense to always buy the latest model. The new models offer very few improvements, often only on paper: the same RAM, the same storage, and essentially the same camera and processor. 
In fact, you are buying the same phone but at double the price (so much so that even aesthetically the various vintages are becoming more and more the same).
So for this reason it makes no sense to me to buy the latest model at double the price of the previous one, and 800 euros is the most I would spend on a phone in 2025",0,the s<num> isn t very revolutionary  it s a great phone  but i would wait for the september offers to get it  the s<num> will solve the aesthetic problems of the <num>  but it will also be the same as the <num>  which in turn is the same as the s<num>  let me explain better  in my opinion  for <num> years up to today  all high end phones  s series in samsung  and iphones  have reached a level of hardware power  <num>gb ram  <num>gb storage  much higher than can ever be exploited by their software  in normal use  but also for the majority of phone games   so it no longer makes sense to always buy the latest model  the new models offer very few improvements  often only on paper  the same ram  the same storage  and essentially the same camera and processor   in fact  you are buying the same phone but at double the price  so much so that even aesthetically the various vintages are becoming more and more the same   so for this reason it makes no sense to me to buy the latest model at double the price of the previous one  and <num> euros is the most i would spend on a phone in <num>

"Had the flip5 for about 2 years and was also a bit worried if it will last long enough and also durable enough for my usage. And I have to say after everything it went trough (falling down a few unlucky times before I got a case, falling in water and lots of dust) I never had any serious problems. Also had the flip counter and im numot sure right now but had around 20k flips (but the first 6 months I didn't have the counter so should be something around 25k i guess).

The only thing I noticed in the last months was that it actually got a but harder to open in a uncomfortable way. I guess thats because after this time there is maybe too much dust in the hinge.

Today my flip7 arrived because I wanted the upgrade and also the bigger screen on the outside. And it such an improvement to my flip 5. The phone is a little bigger in general, the screen borders inside and outside are smaller and especially the inside had a bit of a high difference in the corners (probably to protect the screen when closing).

And the biggest improvement which I would never new would be such a change in the whole user experience is the you really don't notice its a foldable phone because the inside screen hasn't any visible or even noticeable gap where its folded. Because that was one of the things i didn't like that much about my flip 5 but it wasn't that much of a problem got very fast used to that and it was only visible if you looked at it from the side.

I would recommend you trying the flip 7 if you want to have a good foldable phone. Its also very nice how small it is when closed. Which is one of the best things about it for me because i not always have pockets where a normal sized phone would fit that easily.

"I just recently got my Flip6 to replace the Flip4.¬†


Some things to note:
- Samsung rates their Flip7 screens at 200,000+ open/closes or more than 5 years at 100 opens/closes per day (average)
- Flip7 uses Exynos chip not Snapdragon.¬†
- Flips tend to get HOT and throttle and stop charging. The Exynos runs cooler but reviews still say it overheats on a hot day.

"Ive been on an Iphone 14 Pro Max for the last 2 years or so and recently got the flip for free through a promotion with ATT. I traded an old flip3 to accomplish this. So I still got to keep my iphone for wifi use at home.

I 100% didnt need to change phones but I figured I would because why not.

Not sure I made the right decision. The iphone feels much more premium and runs much more smoothly. Much nicer screen visually as well.

The battery, despite being 2+ years old also lasts much longer and charges way way way faster. This is really my biggest concern. Battery and charging on this thing is just absolutely unacceptable for me.

Im not a Samsung hater or anything and I bet the flagship non foldable Galaxy phones are similar to flagship iphones, but the way I see it is that if you are on a ""Pro"" Iphone you need to understand that going to a Samsung foldable right now is overall going to be like dropping down a tier of ""premiumness"".",1,ive been on an iphone <num> pro max for the last <num> years or so and recently got the flip for free through a promotion with att  i traded an old flip<num> to accomplish this  so i still got to keep my iphone for wifi use at home  i <num>  didnt need to change phones but i figured i would because why not  not sure i made the right decision  the iphone feels much more premium and runs much more smoothly  much nicer screen visually as well  the battery  despite being <num>  years old also lasts much longer and charges way way way faster  this is really my biggest concern  battery and charging on this thing is just absolutely unacceptable for me  im not a samsung hater or anything and i bet the flagship non foldable galaxy phones are similar to flagship iphones  but the way i see it is that if you are on a  pro  iphone you need to understand that going to a samsung foldable right now is overall going to be like dropping down a tier of  premiumness

"To be honest, I was not interested in using foldable phones lately (especially the clamshell one).

"After 6 months the screen protector is going to start to peel off. Unfolding your phone every time you want to use it can get old pretty quick.

"I‚Äôve been using the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for a while now after trading in my iPhone 13, and while it definitely has some cool features, there are important things you should know before buying a Samsung Flip Phone.

Pros:

Compact & Sleek Design: The main reason I bought this phone it folds neatly and is super pocket-friendly.

Back Camera Selfies: Using the rear camera for selfies via the cover screen is a great feature and produces high-quality shots.

Decent Performance: Smooth experience overall for daily tasks, apps, and multitasking.

Flex Mode Features: Handy for video calls, tripod-style photography, and watching videos without a stand.

The Bad (And There‚Äôs Quite a Bit):

1. Fragility:
This phone is extremely fragile. Even with cases that cover both the back sides, a fall, especially on the folded edge can be fatal. The hinge and inner screen are vulnerable, but there are cases that protect them, but its bulky and ruins the overall look and feel of the phone.

2. Screen Protector Issues:
The pre-installed inner screen protector started showing large bubbles in the middle just 6 months in. It‚Äôs a known issue.

If you don‚Äôt replace it in time, the screen itself can crack.

My friend removed the screen protector after it came off on his Z Flip 5, and the screen broke the very next day, the replacement cost: INR 24,000 (USD 280).

The screen protector itself is expensive. I was quoted INR 1,600 (USD 20), and after a long argument with Samsung reps, they reduced it to INR 600 (USD 7).

Final Verdict:

If you‚Äôre considering the Galaxy Z Flip 7, only buy it if you‚Äôre fully prepared to baby the phone.
It‚Äôs a premium product with a unique form factor, but the joy of the compact design fades quickly when you start worrying about screen bubbles, hinge falls, and pricey repairs.

I personally regret getting the Flip and would‚Äôve been much happier with a Galaxy S24 or even waiting for the S25.

"Yeah, it‚Äôs called rolling debt or the perpetual upgrade trap. Carriers were pulling this kind of move long before Samsung jumped in with their trade-in program. Samsung basically admits how fast these phones lose value when you look at their own trade-in offers. The Fold 6 256GB launched at $2,564.99 CAD, and just a year later they‚Äôre offering $1,045 for it. That‚Äôs a loss of over 60 percent in 12 months. I still upgrade every year because I like folding phones, but they‚Äôre not at the point where I‚Äôd actually keep one long-term. The changes are small, and honestly, I hate them, but they‚Äôre slowly getting to a place where a foldable feels like a proper daily driver.

I kept my S22 Ultra for over three years because the upgrades weren‚Äôt worth it, but the Fold isn‚Äôt quite there yet.

"For personal reference: Reasons for me not upgrading to the Fold 7

1. Losing the S pen support despite being a mini tablet
2. Losing the UDC, and having a large inner camera hole being visible during a video
3. Losing the vapor chamber not being able to utilize the Snap 8 Elite chipset's full performance and disperse heat uniformly. (YouTube review comparisons show Fold7 to have 3 degrees lower temperature with near identical battery time compared to Fold6 on workload tests)
4. No upgrade in batteries, despite wider screen, leading to barely no battery time increase despite the Snap 8 Elite chipset (Some youtube reviews show the battery time to be even *shorter* than the Fold6)
5. Worse speakers performance due to thinner thickness and smaller sound space
6. Wider screen not being an upgrade for videos
7. Wider screen and heavier camera on the top giving a worse weight distribution
8. Thinner thickness and upgrade in camera module leading to the outer camera bulk being extremely protruded, making the phone wobble when laid flat
9. Thinner thickness leading to smaller buttons and making it harder to grip and open
10. Youtube reviews show the Fold7 does not open completely flat (180 degrees) and slightly less than the Fold 6

"Indeed, the only thing they said is they absorbed some cost (as in, the Fold 7 is slightly more expensive to make, but the price didn't increase proportionally) and nobody even hinted at losing money. 

Foldables come with high profit margins that would be insane if they could scale sales and make them mainstream, which is what Samsung is trying to work towards without giving in on pricing to the point those margins become notably less cushy. 

Personally, I think it's a losing gamble. They were first and could've taken that market by storm. But holding onto their golden egg gamble meant little demand for a $2000 device that's technically less capable and less robust than a much cheaper Ultra, and also allowed time for Chinese rivals to catch up offering similar or better hardware for far less, leading global adoption outside of North America.",0,indeed  the only thing they said is they absorbed some cost  as in  the fold <num> is slightly more expensive to make  but the price didn t increase proportionally  and nobody even hinted at losing money   foldables come with high profit margins that would be insane if they could scale sales and make them mainstream  which is what samsung is trying to work towards without giving in on pricing to the point those margins become notably less cushy   personally  i think it s a losing gamble  they were first and could ve taken that market by storm  but holding onto their golden egg gamble meant little demand for a  <num> device that s technically less capable and less robust than a much cheaper ultra  and also allowed time for chinese rivals to catch up offering similar or better hardware for far less  leading global adoption outside of north america

"Earlier this week, Samsung [announced](https://www.wired.com/story/everything-samsung-announced-at-its-summer-galaxy-unpacked-event-july-2025/) the latest generation of its high-end foldable phones at its Summer Galaxy Unpacked event. The Galaxy Z Fold7 and the Galaxy Z Flip7 are variously lighter, thinner, less crease-prone than before. They are more expensive too. Some call them the ‚Äúfoldables to beat.‚Äù

It‚Äôs Samsung messaging and a commentator response that sounds an awful lot like what we heard last year. And the year before that, for that matter, in a hall of echoes typical of the iterative progress loop much of consumer tech hardware has fallen into. It's not that we think they'll be bad‚Äîwe liked their predecessors [just fine](https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-and-galaxy-z-flip6/). It's just that when you compare them to the progress being made by Chinese competitors, they feel a bit dull, and already a step behind in an area they are widely thought to lead.

Yes, calling the latest tech boring has a touch of The Simpsons' ‚ÄúOld Man Yells at Cloud‚Äù meme energy to it. But it‚Äôs symptomatic of a truth that could have serious implications further down the line for all of us: China is winning consumer tech, in a big way.

"They do go above and beyond...but I think that is because of how competitive the market is. With each of the six major players having about a 15 percent marketshare (Vivo, Oppo, Honor, Xaomi, Samsung, Apple) in China, they have to compete, or no one will buy their products.

The Western market is terrible. The three big players (Apple, Samsung, Google) are content to be anti-competitive and keep reusing the same batteries, camera sensors, screens, etc year after year while also gradually taking away useful functionality (while, at the same time, convincing their customers that removing a feature is a good thing).

This is why I strictly shop on the global market. I refuse to give any money to Apple, Samsung, or Google when they all share the same level of mediocrity in the smartphone space. I do not know what you mean by ""earning the same respect"" as Apple or Samsung. If anything, those brands have proven to do anything but listen to what their customers want. I expect the smartphone market in the West to look very similar to that in the East over the next few years if Samsung and Apple continue to ""play it safe"" by refusing to innovate. I would say your assumption that Chinese tech is ""cheap"" is completely unsubstantiated. Cheaper in cost to the consumer? Yes, but that is because Apple and Samsung inflate their prices arbitrarily, hoping their customers will just pay it.

Where is this gap? Android and iOS have become American devices biggest liabilities. The FBI has basically told the entire country to stop texting or clicking links on these devices because they're not secure.

American operating systems are designed for the needs of the management team running the company, not the end user. Apple keeps adding AI features that no one wants in ways that destroy and concept of privacy on the device. Microsoft is adding a feature that essentially turns Windows into NSO-group style spyware (windows recall). And at this point Android just seems like one giant backdoor.


""Our software is our advantage"" would have been true a couple decades ago but management of that infrastructure was taken from creative innovators like Steve Jobs and put in the hands of corporate hatchetmen like Tim Cook. Watching our tech companies try to interface with European markets should give you a hint about where America's tech debt is coming from. These countries are looking at these companies and apps and deciding that their core business models are illegal. America's corporate culture, and their predatory lobbying apparatus, have rendered our most powerful companies completely incompetent and rather than investing in their products and users they're simply pushing economic isolationism in order to protect their ill-gotten marketshare.",1,> closing the gap where is this gap  android and ios have become american devices biggest liabilities  the fbi has basically told the entire country to stop texting or clicking links on these devices because they re not secure  american operating systems are designed for the needs of the management team running the company  not the end user  apple keeps adding ai features that no one wants in ways that destroy and concept of privacy on the device  microsoft is adding a feature that essentially turns windows into nso group style spyware  windows recall   and at this point android just seems like one giant backdoor   our software is our advantage  would have been true a couple decades ago but management of that infrastructure was taken from creative innovators like steve jobs and put in the hands of corporate hatchetmen like tim cook  watching our tech companies try to interface with european markets should give you a hint about where america s tech debt is coming from  these countries are looking at these companies and apps and deciding that their core business models are illegal  america s corporate culture  and their predatory lobbying apparatus  have rendered our most powerful companies completely incompetent and rather than investing in their products and users they re simply pushing economic isolationism in order to protect their ill gotten marketshare

"This is really interesting to me, Samsung S series line became popular due to it being a spiritual replacement for a black berry.


They leaned into this up until the S5. It had a replaceable battery, and a high bandwidth data port for file management. It turned out, consumers liked the black berry look more for the aesthetic of being high business, not the actual functionality of that class (similar to ford F150s being used to haul groceries). 


So Samsung pivoted with the s6, but still supported the note line up. When people walked into a store and saw a Samsung phone. The first one they always pivot to, was the note line up, not because of its big screen, but because of its pen. Were they note-takers? No, but they liked the aesthetic of one, so they get the closest thing to that, which is the S line. This continues throughout the ultra line, and with the foldables. Samsung removes things like headphone ports, removable batteries, IR sensors so on; but they keep the s-pen and even add dex. Because someone there knew how vital it was to the appearance of the brand. 


Now with this most recent one, they remove the s-pen. Did people use it? Sure some Artists, Beauty Influencers, Accountants, Small businesses, Healthcare, Students, etc, but majority of the user-base didn‚Äôt. 


Some people in Samsung wanted to make the phone slimmer, looked at the data, and sacrificed the digitizer.  It seems someone somewhere forgot or maybe does not know why people chose Samsung over any other Brand. 


What confuses me, is why now? Why do it when AI workflows and tools are about to make precise lassoing and sketched diagrams useful again to the common person. The timing seems incredibly strange. It seems like they should lean into it once more, not away from it. 


I can‚Äôt help but feel they‚Äôre making a mistake that will be have effects much larger negative effects than anyone would have expected, but I guess we‚Äôll see where this takes them in the next couple years.

The Z Fold series is a quasi-tablet and every tablet has digitization abilities with stylus (to my knowledge) so who fell asleep at the wheel here?

Can anyone make sense of this? And before doing so, I get a long just fine using a case with integral pen slot for my Z Fold 5 and would simply do the same here (in other words, no need for an S Pen slot within the device itself)...

I can't put my finger on it. Was it the Ultra name that Samsung decided to use, same as Apple? Is it the orange band? The naming of the band, Ocean vs marine? The square design? 

What about their earbuds? Why did Samsung go from their tried and true bean design to the Apple airpod shaped design?

u/MysticYogi0104 I guess it all depends on usage.  For us it's actually cheaper to stick with T-Mobile because we're paying $200 for 6 lines (2 free lines) and a free watch line.  My wife and I get a new upgrade every year and our kids get a free 1 year old hand me down.  I also use the other 2 free lines as hotspots and upgrade whenever my parents need a new phone or when their device is close to end of life and I can still get maximum value trade in hence why I mentioned that the previous person shouldn't trade in their device that has value in it when they can just find a cheap trade in.,1,u mysticyogi<num> i guess it all depends on usage   for us it s actually cheaper to stick with t mobile because we re paying  <num> for <num> lines  <num> free lines  and a free watch line   my wife and i get a new upgrade every year and our kids get a free <num> year old hand me down   i also use the other <num> free lines as hotspots and upgrade whenever my parents need a new phone or when their device is close to end of life and i can still get maximum value trade in hence why i mentioned that the previous person shouldn t trade in their device that has value in it when they can just find a cheap trade in

"Not really, Exynos nowadays does carry similar performance to snapdragon, however sustained heat is worse on Exynos models, meaning that for people who don't play games or keep up high pressure on their devices it's fine, but if you're keeping up heavy resource usage then the heat bottlenecks Exynos more than snapdragon, the difference is about 20%, also Exynos have a higher idle temperature than snapdragons, fortunately the battery usage is about the same for both chipsets

Snapdragon also has somewhat better video processing and camera details, but Exynos does better on softening pixels on cropped photos.

It's also important to note Exynos has a few bugs when it comes to sleeping or using low power states, for example the Exynos 1380 using a hotspot prevents the device from using its 4 low power cores exclusively, causing a device to usually burn all its battery in 5-6 hours, even if you weren't using it and keeping the screen off.

"The real deal breaker for me is that interior punch hole camera replacing the under display camera.

Stuff like being able to play audio from multiple apps/sources at once, sorting notifications by time received, and being able to change the task switcher to something more compact and easily scrollable is some stuff that generally isn't possible outside Samsung's phones from what I've seen... at least, not without rooting and using some custom OS (which tends to block access to certain apps without workarounds, I hear).

Having never owned a fodable phone, I can't speak on how much of the heavy customization I get in my S24 Ultra would carry over to a Z Fold phone, but I'd hazard a guess the Z Folds in general have the best software of any folding phone... even if Samsung is making some frustrating choices with the hardware and pushing way too hard on the AI stuff (that most people see as pointless gimmicks at best).

"You're technically right that aluminum is lighter than titanium by weight, but that's not the whole story in smartphone design.

Titanium is much stronger than aluminum, which means manufacturers can use thinner or less material to achieve the same or even better structural strength. That can reduce overall weight despite titanium‚Äôs higher density.Also, many phones with titanium frames are actually lighter than their aluminum or stainless steel versions, because the internal design is optimized around titanium‚Äôs strength.And even if it's not ""100% titanium,"" that thin outer layer still adds a lot more durability and scratch resistance compared to aluminum. So it‚Äôs not just for looks, it has a real functional advantage.

"""Circle to Search"" is frankly a game-changer for me, the more I came to use it on my Galaxy S24 Ultra. Being able to simply hold home and then select some text (that may not be selectable otherwise) or tap an image to quickly research text or an image in a pop-up window, without having to (manually) open a new tab/app to search in is frequently very convenient. Being able to do similar such stuff with ""Smart Select"" using my S-pen is also quite handy other times. As someone that frequently browses browses/views content in other languages (despite only knowing English well), I'm also a huge fan of the ability to quickly translate stuff in any language to English on this phone, be it by translating the entire screen at any given moment with Circle to Search or by translating text I point the S-pen at with the Air Command menu's Translate option.

Having said all that, the translation functionality is not as simple, fluid, and universal as I imagine it theoretically could be. With Circle to Search, I need to repeatedly hold home and tap translate every time I reach a new screen or see new text. With the S-pen translation, I need to keep pointing at every little bit of foreign text I want to understand. Many browser applications already allow you to automatically translate pages in foreign languages to your own language, but it'd be nice if this functionality was available at a system level, so foreign languages across any app could automatically be translated into your language.

Basic level would just be automatically translating selectable text, but it'd be extra nice if they could also translate text in images and maybe even translate audio (when Live Captions are active). That way, I could say, watch a Japanese-speaking livestreamer in an app like Youtube or Twitch and at least understand what their primarily Japanese-speaking viewers are saying in their chat, plus possibly understand the streamer. Samsung already has AI functionality to translate calls, texts, and spoken conversations, so it'd be nice if this could just be a more universal and automatic thing.

Also, on another note, I log all my meals in Samsung Health and regularly wind up having to add custom foods because the FatSecret database is hardly all-encompassing. However it's a huge hassle to have to enter the food name and up to 15 different nutrient values for every custom food... especially when the order of nutrients on labels isn't too consistent. Would be amazing if there was a function (through AI or otherwise) that let me point my phone camera at a nutritional label to extract the nutrient numbers and populate them in a custom food. Even better if it can analyze an image/table with nutritional details for several items at some (fast) food place and automatically pull the relevant numbers for the item name you specify (cause good god it's an ordeal with some of those nutrition sheets when they have dozens of rows/columns in a static PDF/image).",1, circle to search  is frankly a game changer for me  the more i came to use it on my galaxy s<num> ultra  being able to simply hold home and then select some text  that may not be selectable otherwise  or tap an image to quickly research text or an image in a pop up window  without having to  manually  open a new tab app to search in is frequently very convenient  being able to do similar such stuff with  smart select  using my s pen is also quite handy other times  as someone that frequently browses browses views content in other languages  despite only knowing english well   i m also a huge fan of the ability to quickly translate stuff in any language to english on this phone  be it by translating the entire screen at any given moment with circle to search or by translating text i point the s pen at with the air command menu s translate option  having said all that  the translation functionality is not as simple  fluid  and universal as i imagine it theoretically could be  with circle to search  i need to repeatedly hold home and tap translate every time i reach a new screen or see new text  with the s pen translation  i need to keep pointing at every little bit of foreign text i want to understand  many browser applications already allow you to automatically translate pages in foreign languages to your own language  but it d be nice if this functionality was available at a system level  so foreign languages across any app could automatically be translated into your language  basic level would just be automatically translating selectable text  but it d be extra nice if they could also translate text in images and maybe even translate audio  when live captions are active   that way  i could say  watch a japanese speaking livestreamer in an app like youtube or twitch and at least understand what their primarily japanese speaking viewers are saying in their chat  plus possibly understand the streamer  samsung already has ai functionality to translate calls  texts  and spoken conversations  so it d be nice if this could just be a more universal and automatic thing  also  on another note  i log all my meals in samsung health and regularly wind up having to add custom foods because the fatsecret database is hardly all encompassing  however it s a huge hassle to have to enter the food name and up to <num> different nutrient values for every custom food    especially when the order of nutrients on labels isn t too consistent  would be amazing if there was a function  through ai or otherwise  that let me point my phone camera at a nutritional label to extract the nutrient numbers and populate them in a custom food  even better if it can analyze an image table with nutritional details for several items at some  fast  food place and automatically pull the relevant numbers for the item name you specify  cause good god it s an ordeal with some of those nutrition sheets when they have dozens of rows columns in a static pdf image

 It'd be nice if it could do a more advanced library scan (like Music Brainz Picard) and pull images from online to use for album art.

Smart playlists might be fun (like fitting the activity, weather, traveled to area, etc) (probably removing the very top results if they're too generic).

Pulling info from messages or being able to scan cards in Wallet is nice, so being able to expand that with the camera or a scanner would be cool. More editing and refining options for commands would also be good (like anything that involves ""ads [look up info] to my calendar"").

"Thanks. 

I picked up an s25 recently because my 16pm was too bulky and I wanted to see the now brief feature which was a disappointment. The camera issues sent me back to my iPhone but I was really hoping that my suggestion was possible through geminis live camera ai feature. It wasn‚Äôt.

I think Samsung should work on Samsung branded ai features. On my Samsung I would live for a Samsung exclusive Ai mode where I can turn on my camera for say, 30-90 seconds and it just does stuff like figure out the time based off clocks in my home then suggest actions. Or, suggest that my fan blades could be dusted off. Eventually consumerism will take hold and if it catches a glance at my stove top, it could suggest cleaning my stove top then give a link to the highest rated stove top cleaners.

I think google is really nailing ai right now. Their press function about their ai glasses was really interesting seeing how they can interact with the world when out and about.

You could still use the s21 ultra for another year and wait for the s26 ultra to drop in price.¬†

"ICM a big fan of the EV's, especially BYD with what they're doing. The phones and electronics front definitely seems a little too far ahead of the curve if you can understand what I mean, Silicon Carbide batteries are a really neat an exciting tech, but I've got a feeling it's not quite mature enough yet. I've heard phone with 6000mah falling behind or not matching flagships and battery degradation issues. 

Not that I feel like putting them down at all, I find the innovation great. But I could see why it's seen as too risky for them to go for yet. They've definitely influenced Samsung if the rumours of the trifold are true, as from memory they were the first to come out with Tri-fold phones. I'm hoping to see Silicon Carbide refined and brought forward sooner than later, thinking of a 6-7000mAh hour phone with the polish of One UI would be awesome, especially with a better camera set too",1,icm a big fan of the ev s  especially byd with what they re doing  the phones and electronics front definitely seems a little too far ahead of the curve if you can understand what i mean  silicon carbide batteries are a really neat an exciting tech  but i ve got a feeling it s not quite mature enough yet  i ve heard phone with <num>mah falling behind or not matching flagships and battery degradation issues   not that i feel like putting them down at all  i find the innovation great  but i could see why it s seen as too risky for them to go for yet  they ve definitely influenced samsung if the rumours of the trifold are true  as from memory they were the first to come out with tri fold phones  i m hoping to see silicon carbide refined and brought forward sooner than later  thinking of a <num> <num>mah hour phone with the polish of one ui would be awesome  especially with a better camera set too

Besides the charging problems, a few weeks ago I (or anyone else who tried) couldn't get my S Pen to lock in place. Then about a week later, I try it and it finally worked. 

Having issues with my voicemails. Been using Samsung phone because it has transcribed voicemails. They're also easy to get to instead of having to call in like I read for the Google phone app. I've had messages disappear (notice it when I go to listen to new message). So I started archiving them to make sure they're saved. Guess what? Those slowly started disappearing as well. Was on it other day and had 4 archived messages left, when I should have about 15-20. Right in front of my eyes the last 4 archived ones were gone. Into the ether. The settings doesn't give you a time limit as to how long you can keep your messages. All I know is that you have a limited amount of space and settings will tell you that you have enough space for 30 more messages, for instance. 

I don't like how we can't delete certain apps from our private folder. And I can't change certain settings because my IT admin only has access to it. I don't have an admin in IT. I don't have an IT dept period. It's just me using the phone. 

There's a few other quirky things I know, just can't recall them right now. 

Then there's my Samsung 6 classic watch. I've tried using the audio recorder on it and when I typically play it back there's no sound. I've used the Shazam app so it could listen to a song. Once it worked. Another time it just kept saying it was still trying to give me the song info and never could (and it wasn't a difficult song).",1,i actually had almost the whole thing typed out yesterday  was on my beach chair sitting a bit in the water to keep cool and i started falling asleep  grinning_face_with_sweat  next thing i know everything was gone  i was pissed   besides the charging problems  a few weeks ago i  or anyone else who tried  couldn t get my s pen to lock in place  then about a week later  i try it and it finally worked   having issues with my voicemails  been using samsung phone because it has transcribed voicemails  they re also easy to get to instead of having to call in like i read for the google phone app  i ve had messages disappear  notice it when i go to listen to new message   so i started archiving them to make sure they re saved  guess what  those slowly started disappearing as well  was on it other day and had <num> archived messages left  when i should have about <num> <num>  right in front of my eyes the last <num> archived ones were gone  into the ether  the settings doesn t give you a time limit as to how long you can keep your messages  all i know is that you have a limited amount of space and settings will tell you that you have enough space for <num> more messages  for instance   i don t like how we can t delete certain apps from our private folder  and i can t change certain settings because my it admin only has access to it  i don t have an admin in it  i don t have an it dept period  it s just me using the phone   there s a few other quirky things i know  just can t recall them right now   then there s my samsung <num> classic watch  i ve tried using the audio recorder on it and when i typically play it back there s no sound  i ve used the shazam app so it could listen to a song  once it worked  another time it just kept saying it was still trying to give me the song info and never could  and it wasn t a difficult song

Before One UI 7, my S23U has wonderful battery life (I always use light performance profile). But now, it sucks, the drain was unreal. Previously I was comfortable with 80% charging limit, now it won't be enough and I have to charge the battery full if I want to get through the day.

"S22 ultra had 8g1 chip it was fabricated by Samsung instead of TSMC and is notoriously inefficient and terrible for battery.  8g1 and 888 we're both terrible chips but anything fabricated by TSMC you're not going to notice the performance difference in any meaningful way. 8g1, 8g3, 865,  etc ....

Absolutely do not need to upgrade your flagship phone every 2 years to get decent performance that is absurd. Name me one thing 8g2 chip cannot accomplish that the newer chips can? 

There's a chance you were noticing things based on placebo because you know it's newer hardware and you're trying to come up with internal justifications to buy something. 

But believe me, the 8g2, Even the eight plus Gen 1 which was TSMC they have aged perfectly fine.
