Using an iPhone when I could get my hands on the beast called S24 Ultra was too much for my gentle heart to bear.

        "- Accuracy: ~64%\n",
        "- Macro F1-Score: ~0.62\n",

        "The model performs well on Positive reviews due to their higher frequency in the dataset.\n",

        "Negative reviews are more challenging to classify, likely because of fewer samples and overlapping vocabulary with neutral texts.\n",
